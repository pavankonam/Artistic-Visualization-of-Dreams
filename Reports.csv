Oh yeah I thought about um I bought.... bought fruits so long ago, and I haven't eaten them and I felt bad. And I feel like they were rotten cause all my bananas are old. And I was supposed to buy all these food... cuz I was supposed to like...like... go to the gym and like... eat healthy or whatever. So then I was like I feel bad. And then I was about to leave to go to Indonesia. So then I thought about making smoothies and eggs for breakfast tomorrow cause I'm going to be by myself for a while before going to the ramen resturant. So I thought about doing that. And then I ...um...What else did I do?...Um I thought about this boy that I saw this weekend like 3 times cause he was downtown during dinner time and he's kind of cute. so I thought about him for a while. And then well I kept having this Nick Jonas song in my head, it was really annoying, it was...it was...it wasn't even a good song, it was just stuck in my head.

So I succeeded and now I have this other song stuck in my head, it's called yellow lines, by this like indie artist I saw 2 weeks ago in Charleston, it was really cool it was a happy song. So that's a happy song. Um...and Then I was thinking about something just before you called. I'm trying to think what I was thinking about. Um... dang, what was I thinking about? May or may not have been going shopping at the mall I think. I think I was at forever 21 or something, cause it was...it was really bright and there was a lot of clothes, and it's always bright in that store, but I think I was just walking in. Oh yes because...yeah... that store was right by Sephora, which is where I need to get my moisturizer tomorrow, that's why I was thinking about it, and yeah I was just walking into the store.

185,185_SO3,subject185_SO3.edf,"Umm.... um....What was I dreaming about? Umm... I was thinking about Chris Pratt, like the actor. I watched this really funny video yesterday with him on Jimmy Fallon. And it was really funny, so I thought about that, also because he's like really attractive. So yeah I thought about it. They were doing this karaoke segment, its called nonsense karaoke. So they replaced the lyrics of ""Uptown Funk"" with these like random words that make no sense and it was really funny cause he was so into it. So I thought about that for a while. And then...oh yeah... I realized that they have this...at the ramen noodle place that I'm going to eat at tomorrow with my friend....they have this thing called Onigiri, which is like this rice dish with like seaweed, and really good stuff, I think its like fish or something that they stuff on...in the... inside of the rice and then its like shaped into into a triangle. Its really good. And I used to eat it when I was a kid, so I'm really excided to eat that. And then I thought about going home again, and then thinking about buying shoes....Uh...these shoes.... Adidas, and Kanye West collaboration shoes....like these really cool sneakers....with like houndstooth design...Anyways.... it looks really cool. Every time we go back home we always go shoe shopping with my dad, I miss my dad, I haven't seen my dad in a long time. Uh.... And then...What else did I think about? Oh... I had this really weird brief dream that I was a dancer at this dance studio. I was wearing all black with like a black hat and white shoes,and  I was just dancing at a dance studio, I don't know that was kind of random. But I had a momentory dream about that. Shit I was dreaming about something too before that. I I thought about mac and cheese at Panara. At Panera they have this like mac and cheese that's like really good, they use white cheddar cheese or something it was really good. I don't know why, oh...maybe I saw a picture of mac and cheese earlier today. And...yeah, I think that's it.  I'm done. "
185,185_SO4,subject185_SO4.edf,"Umm....umm..... Ohh yeah. I remembered what I was dreaming earlier finally. So the boy I saw this weekend, he was really attractive, he's like 5 years older than me. He was a English major at Furman. And I met him because I was actually lol waiting for the guy I went on a date with, I think it wasn't actually a data, just like a friend date thing or whatever, anyway. Anyway...I found out he used to go to Furman, English major, and I followed his blog. He said he really like Ernest Hemingway, then I thought about you know, we were talking about favorate authors. I didn't think I would be well-read enough. And then I thought about things I've read and I would say my favoriate author is Plato, which is so cliche and so dumb. But then I thought about the name Ernest like Ernest Hemingway and then I figured how funny it is...like do people actually name their kids Ernest. Cuz that would be pertty cool. And we were having a conversation in front of Anthro at like this little patio area where there was like a water...not really a waterfall...but like a little waterfall and water pond thing in downtown Greenville. But when we were talking about authors, I imagine I would be sitting across from him at a resturant, but it wasn't really a... I don't know which resturant that was, it was just like a generic type dinner place you would go to if you were going on a date, I don't know. It wasn't anything specific. Um....Then what else.... I just had a little dream about something again. Um...I had this really weird fleeting dream that I was on Jeopardy and [first and last name] was there cause he's been studying for Jeopardy. I don't know it was weird. I was not doing very well. That was this little mini dream. And um...I was listening to some music. I still have the same song that's stuck in my head. But I don't remember. I don't remember what my latest dream was. That's it."

185,185_SO6,subject185_SO6.edf,"Uh....Oh. I had a dream about a lot of things... it was kind of weird...in a short period of time... I thought about...I had a dream about Channing Tatum cause I saw Magic Mike last weekend and then yesterday I watched Dear John because I just wanted to see Channing Tatum. So that was the last thing. I had a dream that I met him. And it was like a scene from Dear John he was surfing on a beach and it was raining and it was really sad but it was really awesome cause he was Channing Tatum so that was awesome. Then I had a dream, it was weird, I had a dream about president Obama, Uh...I had a dream that I met him in Indonesia, it was really cool. And then I...like became friends with his daughters and talked about life. They invited me to come over. They were like...""Oh can't you please come over"" but it was like the white house. So that was awkward, but that was cool, that was a good dream. That was a good dream. And then... Umm oh what was my dream before? Uh...um....I was getting a little bit frustrated over something. But I don't remember. Um...I don't know I just remember feeling kind of frustrated, um.. don't remember the detail but um....kind of not in a good place with one of my best friends I know who's gonna come to dinner tomorrow at that ramen place. And then I just kind of started to think about that. We just haven't had very good communication and um.... she kind of expects me to make her a priority when that she doesn't make me her priority, so I think like she was one of the last people I was texting so I figured that's probably why I started thinking about it. Because I remember like shortly before you woke me up that I was feeling a little frustrated, like annoyed and disappointed kind of feeling, it was not a good feeling. But that's all I remember. That's it."
