Hello? Can you hear me? 

Subject
Mmm. Hmm.

Researcher
Are you awake?

Subject
Yep

Researcher
What can you remember?

Subject
I was, I was talking to my brother. Like uh, I don't know why, but we had like uh, we were like supervisors or something, like, a notebook, and we were like, writing stuff and I was talking to him, but I don't remember what we were discussing.

Researcher
Can you remember any previous dreams?

Subject
Pffft. I think one of them was I was, I in a club. But, I don't remember why, or, like… No, I was just there.

Researcher
Did you see any flashing lights?

Subject
Yeah

Researcher
Did you see them inside of the dream?

Subject
Mmmm. In the club, yeah. Because, well, the club tends to have like these, like these uh, “everything dark” but they have like these, uh “dangling lights”.

Researcher
So you saw flashing lights in the club dream?

Subject
Yeah yeah.

Researcher
Did you hear any specific sounds in the dream?

Subject
No.

Researcher
Any music? Any bells?

Subject
No

Researcher
Ok. Do you um, remember at any time, becoming lucid?

Subject
[UNINTELIGBLE]

Researcher
Lucid.

Subject
Uh, I'm not sure. I think I was for brief moments, but I remember trying to do the clenching hand, but I think I did it. Like, not even a whole loop.

Researcher
Did you remember trying to do LRLR to signal that you were Lucid?

Subject
Yeah.

Researcher
Can tell us how many LRLR’s you did, and in what sequence, and roughly what the sequence involved?

Subject
I remember that when I thought I was Lucid, I started, like, doing LRLR, but I don't remember how many times. And I just start clenching my left hand and then my right.

Researcher
Did you do LRLR [EOG VERIFICATION] in between?

Subject
Yeah.


Researcher
And so if you did one Left then one Right, did you go back and do the Left again after that?

Subject
I think I went back to Right, because I remember clenching more times my Right hand.

Researcher
So you did an L, and then and R, and then after the R, you did another R?

Subject
Yeah

Researcher
And then after that?

Subject
I think I went to another dream, or like I loosed Lucidity

Researcher
So you did an L, and then did a R, and then you accidentally repeated the R, and then another dream? 

Subject
Yeah

Researcher
Ok, thank you

Subject
Or I loose focus. Also that happened.

Researcher
Yeah, yeah I understand. I have the same thing. Do you remember what caused you to become lucid in the dream? Was it any kind of… Did you work it out yourself, or did you see a sign or something?

Subject
No it just happened. Like, I was suddenly Lucid.

Researcher
Do you remember giving an LRLR to finalize the sequence, after you gave the final Right clench?

Subject
Hmmm. Yeah.

 


Researcher
Okay. Do you remember doing the counting period, so an LRLR start the counting period, then an LRLR, then the left? Or do you LRLR, then straight away go to the left?

Subject
Straight.

Researcher
Ok. Well, good job. How do you feel right now?

Subject
Uh, [UNINTELIGBLE] rest.

Researcher
Rest well rested?

Subject
Yep.

Researcher
You slept pretty solidly, I can tell you that.

Subject
Nice.

Researcher
I have a question for you. Um. Can you, I mean, shut your eyes for me. Just keep them shut. Can you see that? [TRIGGERED LIGHT FLASHES]

Subject
Yeah.

Researcher
And keep them shut. What about this?

Subject
Also, and its more invasive.

Researcher
More invasive. Was this corresponding with a lights you saw in the club? Is that um, roughly what they looked like? Do you think there is a chance of that?

Subject
Yeah. Most likely.

Researcher
Its hard to tell of course, but um. We’ll never know that for sure. And now I have another question for you…

Subject
Yep.

Researcher
Ok one second. One more second…

Researcher
[PLAYS TRI TONE]. Did you hear that?

Subject
Uh huh

Researcher
What did that sound like to you?

Subject
Like bells

Researcher
Did you remember hearing this any other time in your life?

Like, outside dreams, or?

Researcher
In the last, any time at all. For example, in the last week.

Subject
I remember hearing, two like, announcements in trains.

Researcher
Ok, but not in the dream or anything?

Subject
Not that I remember. One of those was like, this ‘fantasy world’. And we were looking at a mirror. And this mirror made that sound, kind of.

Researcher
In the dream?

Subject
Yeah

Researcher
And what did you think when this mirror made this sound in the dream

Subject
Nothing like, I wasn’t… In the dream, in the context, I wasn’t like, new… or like, it seemed like “everything was just fine”.

Researcher
Yeah yeah that’s just part of the dream. So you may have had had a dream, with a mirror, which may have had a sound, which may have been something like this. But we’ll never know.

Subject
Yeah

Researcher
Yeah ok. [to self: once again, that’s probably as good as we will get]. 

Researcher
Um, yeah thank you for your help. That’s kind of it. If you want to lie there, we have to pull you out in the next 20 mins our so. But you can lie there for a bit, or we can pull you out right now.

Subject
Ok great.

Researcher
Sorry, I was mistaken, we actually have to get you out now, because we have to clean up a bit…

Subject
[Laughs]

Researcher
Sorry about that. Um, yeah is that ok, we come in and get you out?

Subject
Yeah yeah"
s_01/c_01/morningnap_singlepart.docx,"Researcher
Hello, Hello. Hello. Are you awake?
Subject
Yeah, yeah.
Researcher
How long have you been awake for?
Subject
Huh, sorry what is your question?
Researcher
How long have you been awake for?
Subject
I don’t think I fell asleep. Maybe ‘half way’ sleep. Uh, but when you say ‘hello’, I’m like “half way sleep” at that time.
Researcher
Can you remember any dreams in the past 15 mins?
Subject
No, for me, its uh, ‘half sleep’ is not like dreams.
Researcher
Can you remember any thoughts or images from the past half an hour?
Subject
Ok, then I can remember. Thoughts or images. Wait a bit. All about, only people. Like when I’m ‘half way sleep’, all the activities of other people. Not many people, like two or three.
Researcher
Yep. And ah, can you remember doing the LRLR task in the past half an hour?
Subject
Yes. So every time, after you show me, even if I’m still awake, I do the LRLR. So every time that I see the light, I do the LRLR, I do it twice. I think you flashed me, 4 or 5 times? The first time I did 3 times: LRLR. And the second time, twice, twice? I either did it two or three times. And that’s what I’m not sure, how many times you flashed me. I mainly did it two or three times.
Researcher
And when doing it, like before the flashes and right after, were there any images or thoughts?
Subject
No, no. It was, when I see the flash, I could immediately wake up. I think I’m fully aware.
Researcher
But just before the flash, were there thoughts or images?
Subject
Yeah, before the flash, most of the time, I think I’m ‘half way’ asleep. Then, it’s always like, with people talking, with two or three people. 
Researcher
And you could see the people or just hear their voices?
Subject
Sorry?
Researcher
Could you see the people and see their faces, or just hear their voices?
Subject
It’s not the voice, its more about the interaction, could see the people.
Researcher
Ok, so they were ‘really there’
Subject
Yeah. It’s about some kind of ‘daily life’ activities.
Researcher
And ah, and when you see the flash of light, the faces disappear, they’re just gone?
Subject
Yeah, yes I think so. It’s like, every time there’s a flash of light, I think I’m, at least my mind feels that I’m ‘quite awake’, and I totally know that I’m not dreaming. Or I go: “yeah, ok this is sleep”. Uh, yeah


Researcher
So where do the people go when the flashes go when the flash happens. What happens to them, do they, do they run away, do they disappear, do they get sucked into a ball of light?
Subject
No, it’s like, I stopped my thinking. My mind just ‘stops there’. Yeah.
Researcher
So they just, they just ‘delete’?
Subject
Yeah
Researcher
And what replaces them. Do you see pure black, or pure white, or pure grey, or something
Subject
I see, a “white flash”
Researcher
And after the flash is gone?
Subject
Yeah after the flash, they’re never back. And the thing is that, I feel that, when you give flash: it’s like, it’s like somebody awakens me, so first of all my heart beats, so my body, its like somebody awakes me, so then I’m not in the sleep condition, actually only, at last, when you called me : “hello”, even though at that time I feel that I’m awake, but I feel that I can not sleep immediately, my body is not activated.
Researcher
Ok so when the flash happens, the people disappear. And obviously the flash is white, but then the flash only last for one second, so what do you see between the flash and then as soon as the flash is over, is everything black, or are people….
Subject
No, ah yeah, only the white flash
Researcher
And once the white flash is over, what do you see?
Subject
Um, normally black, I know I’m in the room, dark room…
Researcher
And how many seconds until the ‘black dark room’ gets replaced with people again?
Subject
Um, I’m not sure but, every time it flashes, its like I do have some activity, some brain activity, that um, is involving people. So I think sometimes I see the flash, not long in between them, only a few minutes or something…
Researcher
Ok thank you for reporting all that. We’re going to come in and get you now. Thank you for your help."

You turn almost like five times from right to left, left to right. 
I can’t hear you properly anymore
Researcher
Can you hear me now?
Subject
Yeah, I can. What were you saying?
Researcher
You turn yourself from right to left, right, like four to five times. You had some awakenings, and I guess you don't remember these micro awakenings.
Subject
I think some I remember, um, and then every time I turned I was aroused, I wasn’t sleeping. But I usually do that normally, and then I fall asleep quickly. But then, basically like, every time I turned, um, and then that I was actually sleeping, I was dreaming. 
Subject
I’m telling you that, this thing that happened like, that I sort of felt that I was ‘laughing’ you know, I felt that I moved my muscles, my face muscles, because I was laughing at something that I really was laughing at, in the dream. And then after a few seconds I think that I aroused, like I woke up, and then I had this like, strange feeling like, I think I was laughing, like, I was like, [IS IT] OK that they listen to me laughing like you know? That was uh, a bit weird, I usually don’t have this type of, this type of dreams, um, or even that I feel like I did something, you know, that I moved, or whatever.
Researcher
Yeah, maybe it might be related with the task that we tried to induce you, it’s about speech, like maybe that’s why topic forced you to, your dream topic, somehow enforced by us, to be something the speaking or, its talking, laughing, whatever. 
Subject
Yeah, but also I personally I noticed that, I mean usually if I take a nap at home, I will just follow asleep within a few minutes. But since here I sort of like, I went to sleep, you know, so somehow you sort of pressure yourself to fall asleep. And then, uh, I tried to keep on my mind like, ‘just relax, relax, relax your body’ and then I would fall asleep. Because if I was thinking like ‘I should sleep, I should sleep’ then I get worried that I am not sleeping.
Researcher
I tried to talk to you actually, already. It was more ‘motivation’ to get lucid but…
Subject
You tried to talk to me?
Researcher
Yeah before you sleep, there was one small session where I was giving motivation about lucid dream
Subject
Yeah that I remember."

Yeah
Researcher
Can you tell me about your dreams?

Do you remember any of your dreams?
Subject
Yeah, an old lady with an ice cream truck, and a man with leather jacket in Texas, America; that’s when the ‘lights went off’. It was about Texas, desert, and the ice cream truck. It was basically a very old lady, who I would call like, “grandma” or something in my dream. She was staring down and, like, there was a guy in leather jacket was kind of, like ‘unknown’, but didn't seem like he would do anything wrong. But also not like, an ‘unknown’, like an unknown someone. So one ‘known’ person and one ‘unknown’ person.
Researcher
Yeah. Continue.
Subject
Yeah, ah, before that I also had another dream because I, woke up once when you had to come and fix my head. And uh, it was, I think very plain; I don’t remember much about it, but I do remember the lights ‘going off’ twice.
Researcher
Do you remember any lucid dreams?
Subject
Uh, only the ‘grandma’ one where I tried thinking that I remembered where I was. And I tried doing the fist clenching in my head, but I couldn’t move much, because the ‘unknown person’ was there, so I was like, I can’t move very much. It seemed very weird in my dreams to do that. I didn’t remember about the hand."
