case12_sub106.txt,"Karen: Yeah what was your dream? 
Subject: I dreamt I was in the lab here, and the outside world was like the conference room, and there were four people including me in the room, we were just sitting there talking, so I realized it was a dream because I had two other lucid dreams in this session that I woke up form, but I didn’t think they were lucid dreams but that’s complicated. Essentially, I realized I want in the lab, but it felt very real, and I wasn’t able to wake myself up from it, so I wasn’t sure if it was a dream or if it was reality. And i was able it signal fine in the dream, which I should have remembered that, and then trying to remember it I woke up. 
Karen: Cool, do you remember how you heard it in your dream? 
Subject: I heard the numbers
Karen: Cool, just like, from the sky or something? 
Subject: No it’s like from the surroundings. 
Karen: Nice, cool, it’s 10:05 what time do you want to get up? 
Subject: 10:30."

Subject: Let me remember. No I forgot it, I’m sorry. 
Karen: No that’s okay. Do you remember anything?
Subject: About the whole thing or about the last thing?
Karen: Um, the last thing. 
Subject: (No?)
Karen: Okay, cool. Were you having a dream, or are you not sure?
Subject: I was having a dream. 
Karen: Okay, cool, great. So that’s the end of your nap period, so we’re going to come wake you up, okay? 
Subject: Okay."
case20_sub111.txt,"Karen: Can you tell what was just going through your head?
Subject: I think there was a point where I was like kind of dreaming. I don’t really remember anything visually. I was singing a song, or like a song was going through my head, It was the Barber of seville. And at some point I woke up. 
Karen: Cool, and at any point during this did you know you were dreaming?
Subject: Yes. 
Karen: How did you know?
Subject: Um, I do remember hearing the noise. I realized something was going on, like where is my brain right now. 
Karen: Cool, and do you, how many beeps did you hear?
Subject: um, one, I think one. 
Karen: Cool, and did you hear any math problems?
Subject: Yes.
Karen: Do you remember what they were?
Subject: I remember 5 minus 2. I don’t remember the other one. I don’t remember the other one. I know there was another one. 
Karen: Cool, and did you give any eye signals?
Subject: yes. 
Karen: Do you remember what you gave?
Subject: I gave three for 5 minus 2. I think [indiscernible]
Karen: Cool, and so were you dreaming while you were doing these?
Subject: I don’t know, I might have been awake. I was definitely awake by the second time probably. 
Karen: So there’s still a bunch of time left in your nap so you can go back to sleep."
case25_sub117.txt,"Karen: Can you remember anything from you rnap?
Subject: Yeah. [long silence]
Karen: Can you tell me everything you remember?
Subject: I remember [indiscernible] uhh I remember I had [indiscernible] I had a song stuck in my head. 
Karen: Can you talk a bit louder? 
Subject: Yeah, do you want me to repeat that? 
Karen: Um yeah, 
Subject: Well um, (swimming?) [indiscernible] (song stuck in my head?) 
Karen: Cool, do you remember any of the sounds? 
Subject: Uh no
Karen: Cool, and do you remember doing any eye movements?
Subject: Yes
Karen: Can you tell me what you remember? 
Subject: Um, In the beginning I was like, I don’t know if it was training or not. I don’t know, It basically in the beginning I remember doing that. 
Karen: Cool, during the training or afterwards?
Subject: I think Afterwards.
Karen: And were you dreaming at that time? 
Subject: I wasn’t dreaming, but I think I really [indiscernible] I don’t like dreaming realistically, but then because we did that, I think that it affected my dream. 
Karen: You think what?
Subject: I think doing that affected my dream. 
Karen: How so? 
Subject: I usually don’t dream things that are realistic, but because I felt like I had to be aware of listening to the sounds, I was really conscious, and I think it affected my dream and made it more realistic. 
Karen: Okay, cool, Sweet, do you remember any other sounds or eye movements? 
Subject: No, 
Karen: Sweet so your nap period is over [cuts off abruptly]"
case32_sub122.txt,"Karen: 
Subject: Like almost a monitor or computer screen with text written on it. Once I saw that I was like, oh here we go. 
Karen: And were you lucid right at the beginning?
Subject: Pretty much as soon as that text showed up, I was like, alright, I can tell my mind is already wandering randomly, so I’ll let whatever comes next to come next.
Karen: And then what?
Subject: After the text, also I remember specifically while I was observing the text I could feel definitely different sensations in my body, as it was sending signals of like starting sleep, also when that text showed up I was pretty sure I tried to signal stage three or four. 
Karen: So... then what?
Subject: Um, well after that it was like random stuff that appeared afterwards. After that I fell completely asleep, and then it was about two scenarios completely. One on a sidewalk street corner, and the other one was just a normal sidewalk when I walked with a couple friends. 
Karen: And can you say again the sequence of events when you heard the cues and responded to them?
Subject: I remember specifically  the math problem, which I think was 5-3, was the one that showed up while I was walking down the sidewalk. I was just, I remember I was walking beside someone just normally, and observing, “Oh I know this person , we’re walking down a sidewalk, this is completely normal. I’m going to continue to act as if this is normal.” And then I think I tried to signal for one of the stages and then I heard the math problem, and then I tried to answer it. 
Karen: And do you remember how you heard the math problem in the dream?
Subject: Uh, I just heard, I don’t think it was ever presented in a different way in the dream. I don’t think the audio got incorporated in any way, in terms of like being a part of the dream, or coming from the dream, I understood that it came from a speaker. 
Karen: Do you feel like you heard it in your dream body or your waking body? 
Subject: I feel like I heard it in my waking body. It felt like I always had a good connection to my waking body the entire time while asleep, even though I could move in my lucid dream and walk around. 
Karen: Interesting, cool, and what was it like when you did the eye movements in your lucid dream? 
Subject: Uh, that was pretty normal it just felt like looking around. In that situation, ‘Cause I guess having a street corner and street was pretty convenient, because on one side there was a building and the other side there was a street so I just had to look from one to the other. 
Karen: Cool,
Subject: Yeah, I’m glad that worked out pretty well though, I’m curious to see the results."

Subject: Uh, I’m trying to remember sorry. 
Karen: No worries. 
Subject: I do not remember, sorry. 
Karen: Okay no problem. Do you remember ayn other dreams from during your nap? 
Subject: Something about like, so back home like (walking the streets earlier?) 
Karen: Cool, do you remember anything else? 
Subject: Uh, Yeah I’m bad at remembering dreams, sorry.
Karen: No worries that’s fine."

case04_sub103.txt,"Karen: Hello?
Subject: Hi.
Karen: Can you tell me the last thing that was going through your head?

Karen: Cool. [long silence] Do you remember anything else?
Subject: [inaudible silence]
Karen: Can you say that one more time? 
Subject: [indiscernible] 
Karen: Can you talk a bit louder?
Subject: Yeah, yeah, sorry. I was [indiscernible] in a video game. There was a mine, where you had to, like, pickaxe your way through stone, and I was able to just hop over the stones, back behind them. I can’t… 
Karen: Cool, during this did you know that you were dreaming? 
Subject: Yes, because in the game you can’t just hop over the rocks.
Karen: So that let you know? 
Subject: Yeah. 
Karen: Sweet. Did you hear any of the cues?
Subject: I heard the most recent one. But I… yeah the most recent one. There’s a good chunk that I just don’t remember. I have no idea how long I’ve been asleep. [chuckles]
Karen: [chuckles] Um, cool. Did the cue appear in your dream when you heard it? 
Subject: Um, no. The sound… it probably was, but I was in the video game though, so it kinda sounds like the background theme. I think I was dreaming I was talking to my daughter, and that [indiscernible] green corduroy pants. And then when I heard the cue that’s when I like hopped into, started [indiscernible].  
Karen: Can you say that one more time? When you heard the cue what?
Subject: When I heard the cue I hopped into stardew valley just because I think the sounds took me into that world. 
Karen: Yeah
Subject: Yeah, but before that I was, it was weird. So I was talking to my daughter, but she’s two, so she doesn’t have an extensive vocabulary. She had a clipboard, she was like stage-managing. 
Karen: Do you remember anything else?
Subject: I remember things as I was falling asleep. Like, way before talking to my daughter in her green corduroy pants. It’s so… the top of a pomegranate. I don’t know why, but the color and imagery with the little green (spout?) of a pomegranate. And there’s this book she got for her birthday, that she keeps having us read again and again and again, like three times before she goes to bed, and it’s called they all saw a cat. And the cat walked through the world with her whiskers, ears, and paws. And it’s like all these different, and the child sees the cat, and she’s have me turn the page [indiscernible] different. [indiscernible] And there’s one page where a mouse sees the cat, and it’s the weirdest page in the whole book because it’s just black and red with claws and eyes. It’s pretty scary for a kid’s book. At the end, there’s a page where it’s like, “Yes they all saw a cat.” And it’s the cat sitting together with all these different, like sets of people, like these different perspectives of a cat. So it’s got this really big cheshire grin when the child sees the cat. But then a bat sees a cat, so it’s like [indiscernible]. You know how echolocation, so the cat is just like, it’s basically just like a star. And a worm sees a cat, and it’s all about vibrations. So it’s this weird cat together with all of these textures and colors. 
Karen: So that’s what you saw as you were falling asleep?
Subject: Yeah.
Karen: Cool. And did you hear any of the math problems? 
Subject: No. [laughter]
Karen: [laughter] And did you do any eye signals? 
Subject: I feel like I tried to. I remember, like, finger tapping instead of, I don’t know, not my finger, no, I need to do my eyes. And then I fell back asleep. 
Karen: And when was that?
Subject: Awhile ago, I don’t know. 
Karen: Okay, cool. Do you remember if it was from the beginning part or the dream you had later?
Subject: I think it was more towards the beginning. 
Karen: Okay, cool. One last question. Can you estimate how long the dream was, that you were having before you woke up? 
Subject: Like a reality estimate, or how I felt that I was dreaming? 
Karen: Both, one in like minutes and seconds estimate, and one in the number of dream states. 
Subject: I don’t know, it was probably two minutes max in reality, and… it was probably a lot shorter than that. For me it felt more like a half hour maybe 20 minutes. 
Karen: Cool, and just to clarify, you heard one cue right? 
Subject: Yes. 
Karen: Sweet. Do you remember anything else that you want to say? 
Subject: A feeling, umm… maybe I was just paying too much attention to the cat as I was sleeping. I would feel like little, you know, probably just imagining, like trying to get my hair out of the way, like tiny little pinpricks. And like weird I don’t know, like suddenly I would get little (barbing?) and I would feel my eyes roll, like, over to the spot where I was like, woah, where, I don’t know, where I could just feel my heart was…[laughter] in space.
Karen: Cool. Alright cool, well your nap period is over, so we’re going to come and unhook you, okay? 
Subject: alright."
case29_sub121.txt,"Prompt: Describe everything you can remember from your dreams and/or other experiences during sleep, including any details you can remember such as the sequence of events, your thoughts, sensations, and/or feelings.
i remember each time i heard a sound cue or heard a math problem (heard the sound cue more than saw that light cue) my dream would take complete pause. like no one would be moving and my dream wouldnt start replaying until i finished my task. the dream that i can most vividly remember is where i was sitting in one of my old classrooms in high school and i was sitting through class and my old math teacher was teaching on the blackboard and he kept writing down the same one equation over and over again really largely on the blackboard. i cant remember the equation but it was a jumble of numbers. i remember thinking that i understood what he was writing even though for me in reality it wouldnt make sense
Prompt:Were you at any point lucid, aware that you were dreaming while still asleep?
Yes
Prompt: If so, describe when and how you realized you were dreaming.
it was after one of the cues where my dream took a pause and after my task where my dream started playing again but i realized i was dreaming
Prompt: Did you notice any cues, the flashing lights or the beeping sounds, while you were dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, describe how they appeared in your dream. 
it would be only the sound cues or math problems and it would be like i heard something in a far distance. so the first word would be soft and muggy but then my dream would pause and it got clearer. and when i had to draw out the number in my dream for the math problem my vision was black and then the number would be traced on top of the black background and then my dream would start again
Prompt: Did you do any eye movements while you were dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, how many times and what was it like? Were they in response to cues? 
i think around 4 times in response to the light cues / math problems i did left and right eye movements. in response to just the light cues though without the number tracing, my vision didnt go black but my dream still took a pause.
Prompt: Did you hear any of the words while you were asleep and/or dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, describe how they appeared in your dream. 
i dont remember the exact equations, i think i answered around 2 and i remember one vividly because the first number was fuzzy and i only heard minus 3 so i was thinking really hard what the first number could have been and if i got the answer right or wrong
they appeared as a distant voice like as if someone said something in the back of the classroom and i happened to eavesdrop of something. it was difficult hearing the first portion because that was my initial exposure but then when it go to the last number of the math problem i could hear it clearly. it took me a while to adjust my hearing
Prompt: Is there anything else you remember thinking, feeling, or experiencing during the nap? 
my dream was as if i was watching from the outside in and not me actually in my physical body so everytime i heard a sound cue it was only me who turned my head or reacted in response to a cue and no one else noticed it. 
Prompt: If you haven't already mentioned it, describe how you woke up, and how you felt after waking up. If you haven't already mentioned it, describe how you woke up, and how you felt after waking up. 
i woke up after hearing my name through the speaker and remember my last thought before waking up was figuring out my last math equation and what the first number was before the minus 3 part because i wanted to get the answer right. when i woke up i felt kind of groggy i dont know why but that was just how i felt"
case30_sub121.txt,"Prompt: Describe everything you can remember from your dreams and/or other experiences during sleep, including any details you can remember such as the sequence of events, your thoughts, sensations, and/or feelings.
I went to sleep right after we did the practice cues. It wasn't much but i was in my kitchen back at home cooking with my mom for some kind of large gathering. we were cooking traditional korean foods and even went outside to our garden to pick out the homegrown vegetables that we have. it all seemed very fast though, time just went by pretty fast as in like transitions during scenes just occurred right away
Prompt:Were you at any point lucid, aware that you were dreaming while still asleep?
No
Prompt: If so, describe when and how you realized you were dreaming.
Prompt: Did you notice any cues, the flashing lights or the beeping sounds, while you were dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, describe how they appeared in your dream. 
i heard the noise cue in my dream as if there was a speaker in the kitchen and was like a part of my dream
Prompt: Did you do any eye movements while you were dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, how many times and what was it like? Were they in response to cues? 
just once before i was woken  up. my dream took a  pause and i was back into reality knowing that i was a part of this study but could also see the setting of my dream very faintly kind of like in the back of my mind
Prompt: Did you hear any of the words while you were asleep and/or dreaming? 
No
Prompt: If so, describe how they appeared in your dream. 
Prompt: Is there anything else you remember thinking, feeling, or experiencing during the nap? 
i definitely didnt completely wake up when i heard the noise cue because i was woken up by karens voice over the speaker which brought me completely to reality. i felt like i was half dreaming half knowing that i was sleeping for the study
Prompt: If you haven't already mentioned it, describe how you woke up, and how you felt after waking up. If you haven't already mentioned it, describe how you woke up, and how you felt after waking up. 
felt a little groggy like i wanted to go back to sleep and keep dreaming"

Karen: Okay, sorry I’m gonna come in and talk to you because your nap’s over anyway, and then I’ll hear better. 
Subject: I think I might have knocked the speaker down. 
Karen: Oh that’s totally fine, it’s super hard to hear. Can you tell me what you were dreaming about? 
Subject: I think I was having lunch, like I was gonna get lunch for class. I think I might have, there were periods of time where I woke up and then I like drifted again, yeah, so it wasn’t very consistent, but that was the last thing. 
Karen: Do you remember anything before that?
Subject: No. 
Karen: Cool, and at any point during that time did you know that you were dreaming?
Subject: Yes, but like it wasnt, I can’t tell if I knew that I was dreaming in the dream or outside of the dream. Like, I can’t tell…. There were certain times when I would hear the math, and then do it, and then wake up. 
Karen: Yeha, so do you think that you did it while you were dreaming or afterwards?
Subject: Like in the middle
Karen: yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally normal
Subject: Like, I would do it, like I would wake up as I did it. 
Karen: and do you remember what the math problems were?
Subject: There was one, which was 9 minus 8, which I think I answered two. 
Karen: Do you remember how many there were?
Subject: No, maybe four? 
Karen: Do you remember any of the beeping noises?
Subject: Only like twice? 
Karen: and do you remember doing any signals?
Subject: Yes, yes so the beeping noises, I felt like…., I think like the first couple times, or like the two times I can remember doing it. There was one I was like awake for, and then there was one where I did it, and then I woke up. 
Karen: Okay, did it come into your dream?
Subject: It was like an alarm clock. So I think, I was like dreaming, then I heard it, and the dream stopped. 
Karen: and did you hear any of the math problems in you dream?
Subject: They weren’t part of the dream. They were also like alarm clocks. 
Karen: Got it cool, do you remember anything else? 
Subject: No."

Subject: I can
Karen: What do you remember?
Subject: I remember, [indiscernible] where I was talking to a friend, but. I’m trying to remember what friend. So I was talking to a friend in my apartment, and like, just like something was different. Where like someone new came into my apartment, who never did before. But, I didn’t realize it. I questioned it then the dream changed, into like another scene. 
Karen: Ah, cool, do you remember anything else?
Subject: I had another one, but I don’t remember that one. 
Karen: Cool, and did you hear any of the noises while you were asleep?
Subject: Um, no

Karen: Sounds good."
case09_sub106.txt,"Karen: Can you tell me the last thing that was going through your head?
Subject: I was dreaming about having a conversation about my favorite video game with someone I didn’t know. And then, like, it’s complicated. I was in a parking lot at night walking back from target on Sheridan. Then suddenly it was daytime and I was in the video game that I was talking about. Then I thought, okay this is probably a dream. And then something weird happened my entire body, like, in real life collapsed. It felt like it collapsed like I lost control of all my muscles. There was a roaring of blood rushing to my ears kind of sound. I think it might have been sleep paralysis or something like that. But then I don’t know how I got out of it. 
Karen: Interesting. 
Subject: Yeah. 
Karen: So do you remember hearing the cues?
Subject: Uh, no. I remember hearing one cue but I was awake. 
Karen: But you were awake?
Subject: But I was awake so I didn’t give a sign. 
Karen: Okay, do you remember hearing any math problems?
Subject: Yeah, well not during the (normal sleep?) but like 8 – 6.
Karen: Okay, And, were you asleep when I played them?
Subject: i think I was. 
Karen: Were you in the dream?
Subject: I honestly have no idea if I was in the dream or in the state where I couldn’t, like, move. I think as soon as I entered the state, I was still in the dream. Then I signalled I was lucid, but I don’t know if I woke up in the middle of that, but I still signalled because I didn’t know, which was weird. I know this is a grey area. But I didn’t know if I was awake or not. 
Karen: Okay, cool. So you got your sleep paralysis type thing, and you signalled, and then you heard the math problem. 
Subject: Mhm. 
Karen: Do you remember how many math problems you heard?
Subject: I think I heard 3. 
Karen: Cool. And do you remember how many you answered and what you answered? 
Subject: I answered 2 for all of them, but I don’t remember what the first one was. I just remember the last one was 8 – 6. 
Karen: Cool. And so, just one more question. When you entered, when your body collapsed, and you were in whatever you were in, Was the dream still going on? 
Subject: I think the shock value was enough that it stopped. I was just confused, and I thought in the moment that I was, like, in a dream because it felt like my body had gone to sleep. Then I thought I was in a dream, like, in the lab, which would’ve made sense. But the image of the dream of the video game stopped when my body went into that sleep paralysis type thing. 
Karen: Okay sweet, very interesting. You still have about 45 minutes, and those are all my questions so … [abruptly cuts off]."

Karen: Cool, do you remember what they were?
Subject: No.
Karen: Cool, and did you try to do any eye movements?

Karen: Okay, cool. And do you remember what it was?

Karen: Cool, and did you see or hear any cues or do any eye movements?
Subject: A few cues, I didn’t hear any math problems this time though, 
Karen: Cool, and how many did you respond to?

Subject: I was dreaming I was in a cafe that was on the top floor of Swift. Um, and I was trying to make oatmeal for myself and I got distracted, and I was on this like open computer that they had in the lab, and I was just trying to like write some code on the computer. Then I got a message from the computer. Did you play any other sounds during the dream, that was like a high pitch beep. Like a notification sound? 
Karen: Um, no. 
Subject: Cool, I heard a high pitch notification sounds, and I got a notification on the computer in green, that said I was gonna participate in something called the BlueEp lab. And then right about then I got the signal, and I signalled in the dream that I was lucid. Then I looked around. I tried to make some guy’s head explode, because you know, you can control the dreams, but it didn’t work. And then you gave me the cue. And I looked left in the dream, but as I looked right in the dream to answer I woke up.

case31_sub121.txt,"i remember for the majority of being asleep i was at my old house that i was in as a child and i was just standing across the street from it looking at it in the rain and then all of a sudden old memories from different parts of the house started playing where they would just flash in my dreams. but i cant remember  specifically about what each flashback was or even if they happened for real when i was a kid
Prompt:Were you at any point lucid, aware that you were dreaming while still asleep?
Yes
Prompt: If so, describe when and how you realized you were dreaming.
when the light cue came on. i think that got incorporated into my dream and that flash started the flashbacks that started in my dreams. the flashbacks were like a montage you see in a movie and each scene/ memory was initiated by that light flash that was given by the cue.
Prompt: Did you notice any cues, the flashing lights or the beeping sounds, while you were dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, describe how they appeared in your dream. 
like before the light cue just flashed a new scene in my dream and the sound cue was just something i heard faintly in the distance
Prompt: Did you do any eye movements while you were dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, how many times and what was it like? Were they in response to cues? 
i think i cued around 4 times if i remember correctly. in response to the cues, it kind of brought me back to reality (knowing that i was doing this study) but part of me was still sleeping/ dreaming and the two settings mixed up a little. for example, the light cue was incorporated in my dream state with the ""flash backs"" that i had
Prompt: Did you hear any of the words while you were asleep and/or dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, describe how they appeared in your dream. 
i heard three. the first one i answered the second one i couldnt understand fully and the third one i answered. i answered by doing the eye movements and then pictured the math problem on the house number plate thing on the outside of my old house
after the math problem and answering and picturing it on the house number plate, i went back to just looking at my old house from the outside from a perspective across the street. i didn't have difficulty completing them because at that point there wasnt alot of things going on in my dream so it was easy to distinguish my dream state and my awake state
Prompt: Is there anything else you remember thinking, feeling, or experiencing during the nap? 
i felt like i was 60 percent awake and aware i was waiting on some sort of cue and 40 percent still in my dream waiting for something to happen in my dream
Prompt: If you haven't already mentioned it, describe how you woke up, and how you felt after waking up. If you haven't already mentioned it, describe how you woke up, and how you felt after waking up. 
i woke up after my third math problem after picturing on my house number plate. at that time i think i was more towards 80 percent awake because i was becoming more aware of listening for the cues but i noticed that when karen woke me up completely through the speaker it took me a couple seconds to come to fully come back to an awake state which meant to me that i was still in a light dreaming state towards the end of my dream"

What can you remember?

I was, I was talking to my brother. Like uh, I don't know why, but we had like uh, we were like supervisors or something, like, a notebook, and we were like, writing stuff and I was talking to him, but I don't remember what we were discussing.

Can you remember any previous dreams?

Pffft. I think one of them was I was, I in a club. But, I don't remember why, or, like… No, I was just there.

Did you see any flashing lights?

Yeah

Researcher
Did you see them inside of the dream?

Subject
Mmmm. In the club, yeah. Because, well, the club tends to have like these, like these uh, “everything dark” but they have like these, uh “dangling lights”.

So you saw flashing lights in the club dream?

Yeah yeah.

No.

Any music? Any bells?

No

[UNINTELIGBLE]

Researcher
Lucid.

Subject
Uh, I'm not sure. I think I was for brief moments, but I remember trying to do the clenching hand, but I think I did it. Like, not even a whole loop.

Researcher
Did you remember trying to do LRLR to signal that you were Lucid?

Subject
Yeah.

Researcher
Can tell us how many LRLR’s you did, and in what sequence, and roughly what the sequence involved?

I remember that when I thought I was Lucid, I started, like, doing LRLR, but I don't remember how many times. And I just start clenching my left hand and then my right.

Researcher
Did you do LRLR [EOG VERIFICATION] in between?

Subject
Yeah.


Researcher
And so if you did one Left then one Right, did you go back and do the Left again after that?

Subject
I think I went back to Right, because I remember clenching more times my Right hand.

Researcher
So you did an L, and then and R, and then after the R, you did another R?

Subject
Yeah

Researcher
And then after that?

Subject
I think I went to another dream, or like I loosed Lucidity

Researcher
So you did an L, and then did a R, and then you accidentally repeated the R, and then another dream? 

Subject
Yeah

Researcher
Ok, thank you

Subject
Or I loose focus. Also that happened.

Researcher
Yeah, yeah I understand. I have the same thing. Do you remember what caused you to become lucid in the dream? Was it any kind of… Did you work it out yourself, or did you see a sign or something?

Subject
No it just happened. Like, I was suddenly Lucid.

Researcher
Do you remember giving an LRLR to finalize the sequence, after you gave the final Right clench?

Subject
Hmmm. Yeah.

 


Researcher
Okay. Do you remember doing the counting period, so an LRLR start the counting period, then an LRLR, then the left? Or do you LRLR, then straight away go to the left?

Straight.

Ok. Well, good job. How do you feel right now?

Uh, [UNINTELIGBLE] rest.

Yeah.

And keep them shut. What about this?

Also, and its more invasive.

More invasive. Was this corresponding with a lights you saw in the club? Is that um, roughly what they looked like? Do you think there is a chance of that?

Subject
Yeah. Most likely.

Its hard to tell of course, but um. We’ll never know that for sure. And now I have another question for you…

Subject
Yep.

Researcher
Ok one second. One more second…

Researcher
[PLAYS TRI TONE]. Did you hear that?

Uh huh

What did that sound like to you?

Like bells

Did you remember hearing this any other time in your life?

In the last, any time at all. For example, in the last week.

Subject
I remember hearing, two like, announcements in trains.

Researcher
Ok, but not in the dream or anything?

Not that I remember. One of those was like, this ‘fantasy world’. And we were looking at a mirror. And this mirror made that sound, kind of.

Researcher
In the dream?

Yeah

And what did you think when this mirror made this sound in the dream

Subject
Nothing like, I wasn’t… In the dream, in the context, I wasn’t like, new… or like, it seemed like “everything was just fine”.

Yeah yeah that’s just part of the dream. So you may have had had a dream, with a mirror, which may have had a sound, which may have been something like this. But we’ll never know.

Subject
Yeah

Researcher
Yeah ok. [to self: once again, that’s probably as good as we will get].

Yeah, yeah.

Huh, sorry what is your question?
Researcher
How long have you been awake for?

I don’t think I fell asleep. Maybe ‘half way’ sleep. Uh, but when you say ‘hello’, I’m like “half way sleep” at that time.
Researcher
Can you remember any dreams in the past 15 mins?
Subject
No, for me, its uh, ‘half sleep’ is not like dreams.
Researcher
Can you remember any thoughts or images from the past half an hour?
Subject
Ok, then I can remember. Thoughts or images. Wait a bit. All about, only people. Like when I’m ‘half way sleep’, all the activities of other people. Not many people, like two or three.
Researcher
Yep. And ah, can you remember doing the LRLR task in the past half an hour?
Subject
Yes. So every time, after you show me, even if I’m still awake, I do the LRLR. So every time that I see the light, I do the LRLR, I do it twice. I think you flashed me, 4 or 5 times? The first time I did 3 times: LRLR. And the second time, twice, twice? I either did it two or three times. And that’s what I’m not sure, how many times you flashed me. I mainly did it two or three times.
Researcher
And when doing it, like before the flashes and right after, were there any images or thoughts?
Subject
No, no. It was, when I see the flash, I could immediately wake up. I think I’m fully aware.
Researcher
But just before the flash, were there thoughts or images?
Subject
Yeah, before the flash, most of the time, I think I’m ‘half way’ asleep. Then, it’s always like, with people talking, with two or three people. 
Researcher
And you could see the people or just hear their voices?
Subject
Sorry?
Researcher
Could you see the people and see their faces, or just hear their voices?
Subject
It’s not the voice, its more about the interaction, could see the people.
Researcher
Ok, so they were ‘really there’
Subject
Yeah. It’s about some kind of ‘daily life’ activities.
Researcher
And ah, and when you see the flash of light, the faces disappear, they’re just gone?
Subject
Yeah, yes I think so. It’s like, every time there’s a flash of light, I think I’m, at least my mind feels that I’m ‘quite awake’, and I totally know that I’m not dreaming. Or I go: “yeah, ok this is sleep”. Uh, yeah


Researcher
So where do the people go when the flashes go when the flash happens. What happens to them, do they, do they run away, do they disappear, do they get sucked into a ball of light?
Subject
No, it’s like, I stopped my thinking. My mind just ‘stops there’. Yeah.
Researcher
So they just, they just ‘delete’?
Subject
Yeah
Researcher
And what replaces them. Do you see pure black, or pure white, or pure grey, or something
Subject
I see, a “white flash”
Researcher
And after the flash is gone?
Subject
Yeah after the flash, they’re never back. And the thing is that, I feel that, when you give flash: it’s like, it’s like somebody awakens me, so first of all my heart beats, so my body, its like somebody awakes me, so then I’m not in the sleep condition, actually only, at last, when you called me : “hello”, even though at that time I feel that I’m awake, but I feel that I can not sleep immediately, my body is not activated.

Ok so when the flash happens, the people disappear. And obviously the flash is white, but then the flash only last for one second, so what do you see between the flash and then as soon as the flash is over, is everything black, or are people….
Subject
No, ah yeah, only the white flash
Researcher
And once the white flash is over, what do you see?
Subject
Um, normally black, I know I’m in the room, dark room…
Researcher
And how many seconds until the ‘black dark room’ gets replaced with people again?
Subject
Um, I’m not sure but, every time it flashes, its like I do have some activity, some brain activity, that um, is involving people. So I think sometimes I see the flash, not long in between them, only a few minutes or something…
Researcher
Ok thank you for reporting all that. We’re going to come in and get you now. Thank you for your help."

Yeah, I can. What were you saying?
Researcher
You turn yourself from right to left, right, like four to five times. You had some awakenings, and I guess you don't remember these micro awakenings.
Subject
I think some I remember, um, and then every time I turned I was aroused, I wasn’t sleeping. But I usually do that normally, and then I fall asleep quickly. But then, basically like, every time I turned, um, and then that I was actually sleeping, I was dreaming. 
Subject
I’m telling you that, this thing that happened like, that I sort of felt that I was ‘laughing’ you know, I felt that I moved my muscles, my face muscles, because I was laughing at something that I really was laughing at, in the dream. And then after a few seconds I think that I aroused, like I woke up, and then I had this like, strange feeling like, I think I was laughing, like, I was like, [IS IT] OK that they listen to me laughing like you know? That was uh, a bit weird, I usually don’t have this type of, this type of dreams, um, or even that I feel like I did something, you know, that I moved, or whatever.
Researcher
Yeah, maybe it might be related with the task that we tried to induce you, it’s about speech, like maybe that’s why topic forced you to, your dream topic, somehow enforced by us, to be something the speaking or, its talking, laughing, whatever. 
Subject
Yeah, but also I personally I noticed that, I mean usually if I take a nap at home, I will just follow asleep within a few minutes. But since here I sort of like, I went to sleep, you know, so somehow you sort of pressure yourself to fall asleep. And then, uh, I tried to keep on my mind like, ‘just relax, relax, relax your body’ and then I would fall asleep. Because if I was thinking like ‘I should sleep, I should sleep’ then I get worried that I am not sleeping.
Researcher
I tried to talk to you actually, already. It was more ‘motivation’ to get lucid but…

Yeah, an old lady with an ice cream truck, and a man with leather jacket in Texas, America; that’s when the ‘lights went off’. It was about Texas, desert, and the ice cream truck. It was basically a very old lady, who I would call like, “grandma” or something in my dream. She was staring down and, like, there was a guy in leather jacket was kind of, like ‘unknown’, but didn't seem like he would do anything wrong. But also not like, an ‘unknown’, like an unknown someone. So one ‘known’ person and one ‘unknown’ person.
Researcher
Yeah. Continue.

Yeah, ah, before that I also had another dream because I, woke up once when you had to come and fix my head. And uh, it was, I think very plain; I don’t remember much about it, but I do remember the lights ‘going off’ twice.
Researcher
Do you remember any lucid dreams?
Subject
Uh, only the ‘grandma’ one where I tried thinking that I remembered where I was. And I tried doing the fist clenching in my head, but I couldn’t move much, because the ‘unknown person’ was there, so I was like, I can’t move very much. It seemed very weird in my dreams to do that.

And we go down and I was also pretty sure I could do it, for example to go up, to save my father."

And so I ask this friend of mine for information, next to me there is someone, a guy I don't know, I ask him for information too. And there is a lot of chaos in that square. Then suddenly I'm in class and I sit down and in front of me, among former classmates and people I don't know, there are plants there on the desk. And the prof explains."

And at a certain point it was so late that it was already morning, it was already seven forty and I decided to skip the night, not to go to sleep in the morning. And then someone came out of a bathroom next to the room we were in."
DL070/DL070_night07.txt,"Initially I had to deal with trains. I was doing an inspection with a colleague of mine and I had a boss who in reality, that is, was not my real boss, it was another very kind person who told me, in short, what there was to do. Eh at a certain point we had to go to the top let's say not of a mountain, but on a gravel road where it was very inconvenient to go by car, so my colleague asked me: ""do we want to do this too?"", I said: ""eh let's try!"". So we start to go down this road for a while, but then we see that it was really so complicated and so we go back. And then after this boss he asks me: ""but did you go there to see?"". I said: ""no in the end we didn't go because it was really too complicated"", ""ah because that gentleman is waving you where he is to make you understand where the place is"", I said: ""ah okay, then let's try to go back, but certainly very complicated"". And nothing could be seen the landscape of this summit practically and this gentleman with a light, in short, not the light, this lark mirror that mirrored this summit and looked a bit like a fairy landscape, a bit watercolor like that."

And then a typical man dressed a bit like a gangster, with a brown suit a bit thirties so that he was running left and right; I guess I fired a gunshot or something.

Then I was in a middle school and there was also the son of a friend of mine. I would go, ""[NAME1], so how was this week?"" like this, but he, like a good teenager, would say, ""ah well, well!"" but then he would disappear with his classmates, like that. And, then, at the same time I was a little student, I don't know, in middle school so and next to me I had an Asian teacher who was Italian and taught Japanese. We had typically Japanese notebooks with manga drawn in front, and nothing, we had to write, in short, there in Italian, in short; We didn't write in ideograms. And then at recess, there were also some of my classmates from high school and some even from middle school; and nothing, we were happy to see each other again, like this. We tried to skate on the corridor which was a white corridor, one of those made a little of linoleum tiling, the classic ones that you saw in schools, in short, still twenty years ago, there was a white linoleum floor.

Then later, I was, instead, in a class of Chinese children in China, where there was among other things a Chinese friend of mine [NAME1] whom I met when I was doing my period abroad during my doctorate in China and, however, strangely we were in a class like, I don't know, of elementary school students, but something like that and there were all bottles of ink with which they made calligraphy. All of them stacked, cute with an ideogram written on them that I don't know, a drawing, a flower, I don't remember. The bottles were blue, light blue and some green. Oh nothing, they were all on this table. And then later it changed the scene and there was like a pool party with a lady, I don't know, a blonde girl with a little black sequin dress who complained to the organization because she couldn't where the tarts were, something like that. And a lady from the organization who, in reality, was there on a voluntary basis told him: ""Eh but my goodness we have done everything, it is possible that it is missing, that is, they reproach me for the only thing that is missing!"" and then she gives him this tart with sour cherries and this lady, in short, muttered a little about the fact that she was still carrying out a free service and was immediately reprimanded by the blonde on duty.

And nothing was discussed here and there. Then you see on a rectangle at the top left a sort of extraterrestrial aliens of those you see a bit in Star Wars no, so dressed a bit ... then the appearances were practically those of the Star Wars characters vaguely similar to the Kaminoans of Star Wars, but green, who were dressed like the Byzantine queens, so they had the dress let's say of so red ochre and the green cloak with studs, in short, glitter, something a little bright on the finishes. And then nothing, they danced on this rectangle that could be seen at the top left and then below, instead, I was always in the vineyard and I was a character in a TV series about ultra-orthodox Jews; So, I was this brunette lady and her son, there was this child who was my son; and nothing walked in the vineyard, that is, the vineyard, practically, grew as the child walked, so there was this child with the webbing that went, that measured the planting layout of the vineyard and as he went down and measured with the webbing, the vine cuttings came up and grew all flourishing, already with the poles and everything,  in short, as this child walked up and down the vineyard; And no, it was a good feeling there and then, in short, with everything flourishing, a bit of breeze, finally the sun. And then later, that is, at the same time, the scene changes for a moment and there were, instead, the usual aliens again, but this time they looked more like giant frogs, let's say, always dressed in Byzantine clothes, this time there was a fuchsia and a blue one always dancing in the middle of this field like this. Then, suddenly, the scene changed and there was a girl who was in a dairy, but secretly, and, practically, in front of a plate of ricotta and she pecked the ricotta as if it were a crow; but she was a dark-haired girl, with mischievous eyes who was careful to see who she entered; but it was like a Harry Potter shapeshifter and it was a crow, even if I saw it in the form of this twelve-year-old girl eating this cottage cheese.

And in any case he is a person I haven't seen for a very long time, so the feeling was of a somewhat rediscovered friendship in short, of a complicity.

And there was this mountain cottage, beautiful, always in the style of those of the Dolomites, so all made of wood with stone, finished, even with some Christmas decorations. So a really warm, beautiful environment and there was this cousin of mine who says to me: ""ah look [NAME3] if you want to rent it to you or let's see if I can leave this part of the house to you because we don't use it anyway"" and I say: ""ah maybe because this is really nice really, there's really little to do no,  to be put in place"". And so in the meantime the situation remains a bit there in suspense, after a while my mother appears and asks me: ""but then how did it end with the story of the house with [NAME1]?"", I said: ""look, I don't know, it stayed there"" and the scene ended a bit like that. Then, practically, from this house, that is, this house was in a context, let's say, initially, every now and then it seemed rural, in the sense that every now and then ruins seemed to appear around there, in short, equipment, let's say agricultural ruins, so, however, there was also this house in short, very beautiful inside, in short, very well finished, but also outside it was beautiful,  but there were some ruins nearby. Then suddenly, in short, this house was connected to what was my aunt [NAME2]'s old house which was instead a huge barracks, those marble floors and so on and from this aunt [NAME2] house I went to a sort of outdoor terrace that was initially my aunt [NAME2]'s old one with bricks,  With the tiles, in short, red, a little ugly, a little seventies, then suddenly this terrace becomes as if it were a sort of fenced club, let's say, with a gray stone wall, like pietra serena and then the hedge border and inside a sort of green synthetic grass carpet, in short, like this,  and it looked practically like the venue of I don't know what Grand Prix where there was practically the veterinarian of the equestrian center where I go, [NAME4], who was organizing a sort of party in which there was, that is, in reality there were also some horses, but it seemed that we were like employees not of this organization to have this party that was supposed to be,  that is, the level of Grand Prix, therefore very perfect, then everyone was silent, everyone was paying attention, in short, to what the vet was saying [NAME4]. At the same time, there were also some guys from the equestrian center, in particular, there was [NAME5] who is a sixteen-year-old boy, like that. And then there was also a former thesis student of mine who also rides a horse, she also does show jumping, but she is a very snobbish girl, a girl, in fact I said: ""ah there is also this!"" but, that is, in short, it is not that I had a great feeling with this thesis student. And, let's try nothing to organize, in short, this party. After that I don't remember if [NAME4] brings a horse, I don't know, and he goes: ""and here, then, you go here, here be careful"", I tried to be precise, in short. And then it changes the scene and this party starts where [NAME6], who was a former roommate of mine when I was studying at [PLACE1], there was [NAME7], who is the ex-wife of a friend of mine. And there was also my husband who pined because in short, he felt, in short, out of context, he didn't want to be there. And I was very sorry, in short, that I say: ""but what does he have to do tonight, in short, because he is sad, so I have to adapt, in short, to try to make him feel good in this situation"" and then because he felt like he couldn't be a speaker at the microphone and so I don't know he was sad. And then there were also people I didn't know. Then, suddenly we have to go I didn't understand to take what out and we put ourselves in a barracks and there was a person I don't really remember who it was who had to come out of a sort of window to go outside and go get, let's say, I don't remember if it was like sweets, something like that,  He was supposed to go get something outside, now I don't remember and I go: ""But I'll accompany you"", he said: ""Ah if you want, I'll go in the meantime""."

And then there was also the niece, the daughter of another cousin, the daughter of cousin [NAME3] who is called [NAME4] and this niece [NAME4] who was playing with, I don't know, she had found a leaf with caterpillars, but they were so cute, so she was showing them to me, she showed me these caterpillars that all looked like crystalline beads stacked a little cartoonish and she showed me,  He would say: ""Look aunt!"" and I: ""Oh how beautiful!"" like that. And then cousin [NAME1] comes along and says to me: ""so let's make wild boar for lunch?"" and I say: ""oh well!"" and brings me two live wild boars and I say: ""but [NAME1] how do we slaughter them here?"", ""and why can't it be done? You take them, they are slaughtered"" and I say: ""[NAME1] but we can't slaughter them at home!"", I told him: ""these must be slaughtered, they must be boiled, in short, they must be dissected, we cannot do it here in the house, no, it is not possible!"", ""and but how!"", then she was a little angry because she had taken these two wild boars and pretended to make them in the apartment,  So I say to him: ""look if you want I'll call a friend who, in any case, does the track, in the sense he makes sausages and so on, so, obviously, he can do this operation in the stable, in the cutting laboratory like this"", he tells me: ""no but in short, I brought them here, it should have been done here!"", I said: ""oh well!"" and then I talk to [NAME1]'s mother,  aunt [NAME5], who was a butcher, among other things I ask him: ""but [NAME1] wanted to kill wild boars here!"", I said: ""but then, by the way, we don't have time for today because wild boars need maturation"", then aunt [NAME5] who looks at me as if to say oh well, but what do you want to do! And then, it changes the scene and we are, I don't know, in a small square where there were all people with Czechoslovakian wolfdogs, but they were not purebred, some were half-hybridized and had colors like a bit, one was a Czechoslovakian wolfdog, but brindle, so those with brindle like that and they went around,  in short, through this little square and you could see, in short, that some owners, in short, trained these dogs well."

That is, um, it was a place that also had an elevator but we preferred to take the stairs. Um, because there was some sort of uhm TV station that had to do some filming, but I was allowed to be on the stage of [PLACE1] but not down in the street where I actually had to do interviews. It's evening, it's dark, so we go down um, there's a lot of movement and confusion because they were trying to interview people but it's not clear if they are authorized or not and so I discuss with someone, some other colleague who wants to know from me if they have authorization. And I answer that I am no one to know. And then we try to go up these stairs to go back to the offices but they are dark stairs. And I have to find the lights to turn them on. And we go up. We will never arrive. And then there's a big uhm kind of anguish like that shakes me because I hear from other bosses that uhm they want to put me as a company secretary that actually uhm the sound eh sounds nice of a nice thing but it would actually detract from all the work I've done over the years. 

Um, and then I was in the car and I was going really fast on [PLACE1] of [PLACE2]. Anyway it was during it seems almost afternoon, so and I go very fast and among other things I have to pass in the middle near a bus that is stopped and where friends, acquaintances uhm, are stopped by the controllers who were in the meantime getting on this bus uhm they are fined and I pass at full speed at high speed near them let's say with the pleasure of showing me that I drive with even a very loud noise of the engine, like a roar. 

Er, I was like a kind of vacation, alone, and I had to go and wash because I had been at the beach the day or I was dirty. It was sunset I'm kind of in a village and they ask me what I want to drink, because anyway I stop to have something and ask for the usual, that is the Martini with lime that it was obvious that I had already asked for another one the day before. I ask for it, but everyone tells me that this Martini ehm is not good, it spoils the neck of the bottles, in short, uhm of the excuses never heard, like that. And I insist that I want this Martini that is easy. And nothing, while around me there are other people sitting at tables having an aperitif and they all have the usual sort of cocktail which is an orange uhm, clear thing, like if it were a Sex on the Beach, something like that that I don't like. They had also made me nervous because I still wanted to take a shower, but I wanted to have an aperitif because in the previous days I hadn't done it and so they were getting nervous because they didn't give me my Martini. Eh, the stairs were the fact of doing them in the dark bothered me. Eh, but in short, I was able to do them easily. [NAME1] was behind me and always wanted me to turn them on. I tried to push the switch to turn them on but they didn't turn on, these lights."
DL041/DL041_night10.txt,"I was at my mom's um, the day was gloomy uhm, and I find myself in the entrance just before entering the house, at the door, looking at the sky which is precisely that off-white uhm color. In short, like this and a series of military planes pass at high speed and first I see them pass lined up, like a dozen of these planes in formation and then eh they scatter in the sky and at a certain point I see some one uhm pass on different trajectories like this and at a certain point just a kind of spacecraft. It was round eh with a hump. In short, I see these spaceships. I see one, then I see another one that even has two uhm Russian parachutes. And yet another one that just gets close to me, but a lot so eh, it's over my head and it's huge. Um, I'm very worried, but I'm actually worried that they take eh my mom, not me. Um, so I'm going to look for her. I'm worried, we both start looking at the sky, but uhm it's a worry uhm, not strong uhm just uhm weird uhm. Er, then I was always at my mom's in the bathroom and outside the window eh I see a lot eh of dirt. It's dark, so it's like a sunset, that is, a very light light. And there is precisely this land outside, weeds, shrubs and looking carefully outside I see that there is a person, I see arms, like that. And, basically, at a certain point I realize that there is a girl who is inside a kind of bear, but the bear is fake and as if it were made of these shrubs of earth like that. And it's there and I'm worried uh that he doesn't have anything to eat uh, and this. 

Then I was here at home here at [PLACE1]. Something happens, the fact is that I go down the street and I have to take my red car, the Yaris, but I realize that a window has been broken. So desperate because I have to go to the hospital like I get on the street. And at a certain point eh I find a friend eh who has a big car, a big, long Mercedes. And I ask him if he can accompany me to the hospital. So he goes down, he was coming down, he was coming home. He asks me, precisely, I ask her, her name is [NAME1], I tell him: ""[NAME1], sorry, but could you?"". He told me: ""yes without problems, I'll accompany you"". And so he accompanies me to the hospital, that is, so I go up and I realize that we are leaving. 

I have a car. Guido, I'm looking for parking in my area here in the neighborhood. I find myself at the airport, I get off, I'm without a mask eh, obviously at the airport there is a lot of security, controls, the policemen look at me badly because I don't have a mask, but in short, I get out of the car and I'm there I have to talk to someone because I have to park the parking lot at the airport which is very far from where I stay at home. And so I find nothing a policewoman who coordinates everyone uhm, very serious and let's say badass. Erm, that's why he tells me to go and put on the mask and I'm going to put it back on. And when I come back, who pass again in the midst of all these men, these policemen like that, I begin to scream, to scream saying that it is not possible for me to put the car there, also because it is an unguarded parking lot. And everyone, including the coordinator the boss tells me that whatever happens during the night to my car is my responsibility. And so I get very angry and yet I have no other solution than to put the car there which is the closest place to get home."
DL041/DL041_night13.txt,"I was in the house uhm that we should buy, sitting at a table. Um, it was afternoon, like that. And I was with uhm [NAME1] who is a co-worker and we were talking about the house, I mean, how, money, basically money. Er, and then nothing. He was worried because reading notes that I had written in a notebook, there was written about a funeral, like something about the funeral, like that. And I said that uhm it was the money I had saved for my funeral. Er, very naturally. So then, at the end, we say goodbye and at the door I tell him if he wants candy for [NAME2], which is his daughter. He takes this candy, is happy and leaves. And then, the next day, he sends me a message on his phone telling me uhm that he was just listening to the radio."
DL024/DL024_night14.txt,"I was going on vacation, I think in [PLACE1], something like that, ehm with my parents, and my sister, we would come to this place, which was like a panda temple, that is, there were basically pandas drawn everywhere, and these uhm figures very tall, like boh, puppets, pandas in short, dancing. And at a certain point there was a kind of ritual, in short, a show, let's say, with the animals, so all these animals came out of a kind of cave, all these animals came out one after the other, then this ritual moved inside, basically there were bulls that clashed with these cows practically, and there was a kind of eh amphitheater,  where this thing happened, which was made uhm practically in steps, and in every staircase there were these fenced cows, and then instead the bulls were free to move, and they came from the bottom to the top, and then there were us spectators behind these barriers. At a certain point one of these bulls began to charge on the barriers, but there was no one to check, and so my father went down to solve the situation, to which we told him ""you're crazy, what are you doing, let's leave"". So we would go out, and going out uh we would find each other, there was like a meeting of people, I mean, there were a lot of people together, and there you would meet a physiotherapist who was a friend of my dad's, we would talk to him then there was this friend of his, this other friend of his, who was basically [NAME1] but he had gone bankrupt, he had practically ruined himself. That had happened, um, he had ruined himself with drugs, basically, he had squandered all his assets, uhm but it was him with this one of his, it was his wife or a partner, but that is, they were still delightful, wonderful people, then lifelong family friends, so we stopped to talk to each other, that is, him above all, and nothing told us that they had kidnapped him and taken him to this [PLACE1],  where he even risked dying because they had kept him in pitiful conditions, and yet he had survived and now in short, nothing, he was with this wife of his, he had stayed there in [PLACE1], because he liked the place anyway. And since I would have stayed longer than my parents there, and yet I had not yet organized the holiday, I told him that I would have stayed longer and if they wanted we could also find each other, go for a walk together, especially with this woman, this girl who was very enthusiastic, she told me ""yes look let's go around together quietly but uhm we have to learn the language a bit,  because in short, it is dangerous to go for a ride together, that is, two women, without knowing the language, especially when we take a taxi, we have to lock ourselves inside and stay with these - they were a kind of clubs, umbrellas - directed towards the doors and then we have to say this sentence to the taxi driver"" and now he spoke in this strange language, and this sentence meant that we wanted to go to this place and spend so many dollars,  You also had to tell him the price yourself. And then I was always in a place like that, [PLACE1] or something, but this time with [NAME2], we were in a kind of store, which is more than a store it was my house, I had like a bunch of frozen refrigerators, with things to eat just like a supermarket, and then I had a cat too,  in the house, at a certain point uh I had gone to clean this cat's food and [NAME3] came home, [NAME4] in short, a few people to visit this house that I had recently taken, and I didn't hear that [NAME2] had opened it for him and [NAME3] cuddled the cat, and while I was arranging them on top they would come up and [NAME3] would say ""what a beautiful room,  I like it a lot, I want to change it too"" and then he said and that he also wanted to change the car he had just bought because it had a lot of problems, in short, he didn't like it enough and then he said ""you know why now with the fact that we have a job we have each other, that is, we are a bit conditioned and we think we can move house,  change cars, to be able to afford it"" and me and [NAME2] would be like ""yes, you have a job, we don't!"" and that's it. And then at a certain point, it was us in the film or we were watching a movie, but it was a kind of Harry Potter in which there was this kid and who was actually taking it out on himself, that is, there were basically two kids, who were like Harry Potter when he was little, and there was a slightly older man who was giving a speech in front of a crowd of people,  so an important, famous person, and instead the small one who wanted to destroy him, you can see that the big one was bad, and therefore the small one did this spell, but then when the big one tried to... things caught fire, so he tried to solve the situation, and put out the fire, even the small one would get with him to put out the fire. And then they were able to see the future to see who would side with the bad guy and who would side with the good guy and so you saw these silhouettes of people you know, in short, there was himself, this Harry Potter child, then there was Hermione, just Harry Potter characters, and they were silhouettes of smoke that then went to the right or left depending on whether they would be on the side of the bad or the good,  and all of Ron's brothers sided with the bad guy. And then nothing, at one point my eldest niece was with her mom and she had a cough but fake, she was very beautiful."

Then there was a granddaughter of mine who was dancing, ah, and it was a child's birthday and they had called him a jazz musician as a gift, bah, and nothing when he arrived he started to rehearse a bit, the sound-check, in short, and this child shouted at him like ""and go"" as if to say ""enough now go away"" in short, he yelled at him,  Everyone laughed, after one o'clock they started playing and this child was happy and danced and then my granddaughter danced too."

In short, it was a beautiful thing, very exciting and then there was snow in the middle. I argued with my mom or rather I argued, I didn't argue, talking, we discussed things, I realized that I had treated her badly just for free, in the sense that I had made it remains bad in a deep way, and therefore I felt this deep regret inside me, in short, for having done this thing, ehm that is, more than anything else I understood that it is true that in short, parents make mistakes etcetera but I understood her point of view and I understood that I had done it in short, feeling that I had done everything wrong and so oh well, compassionate in this feeling I was.

We had friends who were from Santo Domingo or something, who for problems no, I don't know if about money, but probably yes, they had not been able to return home for a very long time and finally they had managed to find money or but maybe it was also a political problem, maybe they were refugees,  in short, there were problems, they couldn't go home, but they had managed to have a way to go back and so eh they also took us to get to know their home, maybe in Hawaii, and uhm and nothing so in this place to do these documents, there were also my nieces, and there was also my cousin's girlfriend who was pregnant,  and she was about to give birth so we also went to visit her in the meantime, and we saw her from this room, uhm but we couldn't go inside the room in short to keep her company and so we talked to each other from afar.

And then some bananas that they gave me as a gift. And we were followed then and a starry sky. Um, then there was a car. Then my mom was very close with a girl that uhm I know, her name is [NAME1] and I was doing crazy things, I was jealous and there was a friend of mine, my boyfriend's sister who was also there and she said to me: ""[NAME2] but what are you doing?"". And I told her: ""Leave me alone, I have to do it"", like I insulted her because my mom gave him the things she gave me, that is, my mom bought me two lamps and gave them to her and I told him: ""What's the point of giving them to her if you gave them to me? That is, excuse me, give me the lamps and she likes them"" and she would enter and say: ""this lamp is beautiful"", ""ah you want it, beautiful yes you like it, I'll give it to you"", I said ""but what are you doing? What behavior is it, I don't understand why you do it"" and so I was quite angry, frustrated like and I threw stones at them, pebbles, I just teased them, I teased them, I teased them loudly with jokes that were from my friends who were there with me, there was a gay guy and a straight guy who were there,  In short, we gossiped about this, we said: ""Ah look how she dances, look how she is doing"" and the atmosphere was still gloomy, as if something was wrong.

My mom would send me a message and say uh like, it was written like: ""can you buy a dog?"" and with the phone, anyway the first dog I see I take it and it was an Australian shepherd, like the spotted one, then it was white and gray, with a different eye from the other and it was beautiful, it was a puppy and I didn't know what to call it and so while I was looking for the name I called it Twitch and I taught it things,  He was a puppy and I taught him to follow me and I put him on a leash, I carried him around, he was beautiful. The dog is the dog, it doesn't turn into a puppet after a while. We traveled, we flew away. He was queuing up with me, if I called him he would answer then uhm in the meantime when I had taken this dog, I also had another dog, that is, before that uh I had another little dog that was a small mongrel that kind of had disappeared and had a face half black and half white, but the white, that is, the white part he had was just like towards above the eyes,  where the eyebrows, because there were so many dogs similar to him, but they all had the band in a different place, like on the side, but he had it above his eyebrows and I went around looking for this little dog because I knew he was mine and I was sorry that I had abandoned him, so I go looking for him and I can't find him anywhere,  the problem is that the more I look for the other dog the more ehem Twitch would be gone. He was detaching more and more, he was more and more detached and so I tried to get back from Twitch but he was like he didn't answer me. This open corridor inside a church and like at the back of the church there were people with dogs, small and far away and Twitch was playing and I was calling him and I was like, ""Come, come here"" and I was whistling at him and he was halfway there, looking at me askance like and coming back. I called him back, he came back but a little more than half, therefore closer, and came back. I could never catch him and the dog goes back and forth and cannot come to me."

I met [NAME2], we decide to go together and I had already done the route three times uhm the one there of the amusement park, every time it changed, especially in the entrance uhm it always changed entrance; Once there were sheds that looked like sea cabins, another time there was a small low black tent where inside there was uhm someone who was actually a mechanical device that came out the monster, that is the uhm looked like a skeleton covered in black, he would come and take your jacket and pull you uhm,  nothing to worry about for me, however, it bothered me here, more than anything else; And another time there was nothing at all, there was only the entrance, you entered and made your own path. Every time it changed, but it was always the same in the end, that is, the paths were those and so by now I had already done them. In one you entered uh and like you were together with three people, four, inside this machine that was made like a small balloon, low of course, the balloon was low, it was fake and uh by force this car was pulled up and you had to go and hit the hole in the ceiling that you didn't drive, but you were always afraid of not getting there because it was slow,  Painfully slow. And then there were many paths inside, you managed to get out, you came back. This one with [NAME2] before entering the main entrance we were inside this dungeon, there was a dungeon, we were under uhm in line and I saw from the perspective of all of them waiting to enter, and they were a row uhm in ascending order from strongest to poorest, but according to the logic of Pokemon. That is, there are infinite Pokemon, there are so many, and these guys here were in order like Pokemon. Among other things, looking at them they looked like dolls, they didn't have the truly human form, they looked like dolls. Many of them I recognized guys I know, a lot of them, like the small groups. And I was part of them, I saw from my perspective that I was like a spectator, and then they, little by little, from this background of rocks and white floor, that is, it looked like something built from nothing in nature, from this thing here they slowly climbed and entered the cave to then enter the surface,  in the outside, to enter the outside. And as they climbed I added myself. I get to be last, along with [NAME2] and other people and [NAME1] didn't answer, that is, he didn't come, I didn't have time to call him. We go up, we enter the playground and I find myself with [NAME2], only I was scared, so I stand behind him, as if he were parrying me. We don't talk because there is no need to talk, there was no need to say anything, then I already know about him, he already knows about me and so we leave. We made the path where at a certain point he and I almost united, that is, I no longer saw his full figure and he didn't even see mine, it was as if we had merged, that to help us even more, to overcome this level, because if you didn't overcome it you would die. Ehm the hardest route was a climbing path, a kind of climbing, uhm it started quite horizontal and as it climbed this wall it came vertically, totally and had no holds. And it was a beautiful feeling, you started ok but even from the middle onwards you went up thanks to a strange push, as if there was someone blowing below you and you go thanks to that. So you use arm strength, you don't use your feet, you use arm strength and you go, as soon as you get into the rhythm you go, there's nothing holding you back. It was beautiful because you really felt you think a kilo, instead of fifty, sixty, seventy. A kilo, you went with these arms that were very light, a very light body, like that. While [NAME2] and I were leaving, there was a guy who had already done it, he was up there waiting for us. The other girls were down waiting for their turn. Then as soon as he left they too went, that is, all together. [NAME2] and I leave and all right up to more than half of us felt our legs give way, our arms give way, that is, no longer have the strength. Then I imagined myself, I thought when I was there of a werewolf. I felt as if I was turning into a werewolf and with strength I began my push, it was just a thing, push, strength, but more rhythm, here, rhythm of arms. A quarter from the end, we were at the top, on my left there was a door. There was this door as if it were a door to an entrance of an ancient house, old in the seventies and sixties, of gold-colored metal, half transparent because it had pieces of glass. And she was by my side and I wanted to help me with that one to get up, but I didn't even want to touch her. So I look at the door and go further, I continue to climb. It was a strange feeling, because the wall was made of earth, gravel, that is, it was stable eh, but it had many pieces that shattered on contact, these pebbles and earth. As I climbed, sideways, it was as if I was hugging the climb. So I took the track, the climbing, sideways with very long arms and I felt from my left hand, not from the right, as if every time I touched there was a spider, there was an insect, something, an animal that tickled me, that wanted to bite me. Every time I put my hand there was something, zero right. Maybe because on the right there was [NAME2], because [NAME2] it wasn't that he had disappeared, he had merged with me, so I don't know if sometimes he did the part below, that is, it was as if I couldn't see him anymore but he was also under me, that is, he gave me the push and maybe that's why I felt a kilo light,  most of it was done by him, I was fake arms, that is, I was rhythm. He was the one who did everything, he did. And so there was this insect, I said, in my left hand that tickled me so it also disgusted me and yet I had to so that is, there was this whole situation that we had to climb but there was this spider that bothered me. In the end then we arrive at a quarter of the climb, three quarters from the end, we were just very close and we stop, we were about to go down, at a certain point I say ""No, not at all"". So I start to jolt to the left right left right left to give myself a kind of strange push and we manage to climb, I climb to the first things I find on the ground, a stone, a hole, everything, and also to the side wall the one not of the wall while climbing, vertically, laterally, the wall of the room itself. I climbed, there were indentations and the guy who was on top was ready with his hand to pick us up, but I told him no I didn't want to because I was afraid that maybe he didn't have enough strength to hold me and [NAME2] and he certainly didn't have it and therefore he could go down. So no. We go up and [NAME2] and together with this guy who was down up and it was strange, strange because if you couldn't get through that you died, I hadn't seen anyone dead, but for me you died. Ehm then from there I saw a clock on the ground, with the rainbow. So if when you completed the [MISS] path the rainbow, but the rainbow was in a small clock in the middle of a circle, there was the circle of the clock and basically, the rainbow filled the whole circle, so it was a rainbow circle, okay, and you left and the rainbow was completed when you completed all the routes, because when you started they gave you a color,  At the start the rainbow began, so with a certain color, then when you got to almost half erm the part of the rainbow clock started on the right, that is, first it started on the left, it went with its colors and it reached almost half and then it started from the right, that is, it continued to the right to get to the middle and therefore ended only in the center. Above the end of the last game I see this open watch on the ground, in the sense that it was not attached to a wrist, which forms the end of the rainbow."
DL078/DL078_night11.txt,"A plate of pasta, a dog. There was a hotel where I was on vacation with my friends, but I was alone, that is, I was [MISS] this German hotel and I went to change because I wanted to take off a sweater and put on another one, to go up to this hotel. There were no stairs, I had to climb, because the stairs were badly made. Everything did not have a right proportion. And when I was inside there was someone staring at me from the outside to see if I changed my clothes, but he didn't see why I just had to change a sweater, I sent him, I chased him away.

My friend and a guy I know came and told me that they had made this trip and had gone to a strange place, a bit lost and told me that they lost their wallet with money, that is, only money. I said to him ""Man, how did this happen?"" ""Eh the monster that lives there in the sea stole them from us"" and I didn't know what to say, I said ""come on, what does that mean?"" ""Oh yes, they made a video in the security district to check and they saw that in the video you can see a little"". There is this monster, they told me that it goes on him and we don't know how in a second he steals the money in his wallet and goes away. They filed a complaint but nothing and he told me it was light brown, huge, that is, like the house he lived in was as big as his shoe. And he often hid, he almost never showed up. While he was telling me I felt a little afraid, a little afraid, I looked around and I saw a figure while he was looking at me, in reality it was an object, in the shape of a figure, which looked like a coat rack or a clothes rest, the low wooden one, which had half a human shape. And when we were there we were lying down, I was lying down with my friend [NAME1] who is the boyfriend of this other girl that I know, [NAME2] who was with another girl named [NAME3] that all three of us were in class together. I was next to [NAME1]. And while she was scratching me, getting massages, while we were watching TV and while [NAME3] was telling me something, she was telling me something about her parents that she didn't want to finish telling me because it was heavy, so much so that she started crying and [NAME2] told him ""No,  it's not worth it, don't cry, come here"" and then he made her lie on his legs, to tell him stories.

It was carnival or Halloween and so we all had to dress up and go to the square. I dressed, I didn't dress up, I dressed as usual and I went to this huge square, they actually looked like the Japanese streets, which is big all but in reality it is made up of small streets and when I arrived I met a person I know and strange things happened. For example, I would pick him up, turn him over, like pick him up, turn him around and spit glitter on him, which worked like that there, and he would suffocate and tell me ""I can't breathe, I've got all the glitter in my nose"". And then guy would get on his knees, start blowing to get rid of all the glitter and they still remained in his brain, so guy was no longer normal as before, he made strange speeches. Then we get almost to the center and I meet my friend, the [NAME4] uh who was going to another friend of ours, a friend of hers, [NAME5], and so like I run, I go hug her and she gets a scare and she says ""Oh God but you're here"" and then there was a sign next to it, it was written by [NAME4],  like uhm ""The girls I know from college"" or like ""The girls I know tell me that uhm you shouldn't date [NAME5]"" i.e. [NAME5], I ""You shouldn't date [NAME5], it's not good company because it doesn't grow intellectually and remains a"" like, because this guy is gay. And then I read this, I look at [NAME5] and I say, ""What's going on? But what is it?"". And he was very upset. [NAME4] goes ""I never told you but they do this and I'm tired"" and he looks at [NAME4] and goes ""You're the friend I've always wanted"" I kind of say ""I'm sorry [NAME5] there's this situation"" he hugs me, we all stay hugged. [NAME6] came in, my boyfriend, who came out of nowhere and shows [NAME5] like that girl, one of the girls who makes fun of him and says ""What are we talking about? That is, in the sense, stop getting into trouble for someone like that"".

Then I was in a German hotel. How did I get in, that then to get out it was enough for me to do something much simpler, but to get in it was much more complicated. There was really the path to take. On the terrace I look at the descent in reverse and there was a dog on it. A dog hopping here and there. And then there was this garden, there was a yellow atmosphere, like it seems to be in Mexico, actually, instead of Germany. And there was this field, with people having tea, playing with their bikes, children, and I could hear voices in the distance. The atmosphere very calm. And not gloomy. 

Then my nephew, the one who is yet to be born, was born, he was beautiful, he was big, he must have been two years old. He was very close to me, very close. It was calm, it was beautiful, sweet and I enjoyed it well. I always held him in my arms behind me and we always went around together. But I had the feeling of the end a bit bad. Ehm that is as if something had happened, we were very close, it was very nice."
DL078/DL078_night04.txt,"Dressed as pirates, er, in an elevator, and this pirate leaving me a note in a chair that would teach me how not to become a pirate, but how to do something else. Probably, I have to kill a fly by feeling. And there was like a lot of sand, with rocks and lots of grass, a soft lawn."
DL049/DL049_night04.txt,"A countryside in which I was with grandparents, they were not paternal or maternal grandparents but they were grandparents in general so, in truth, I didn't know them. And the atmosphere was very beautiful, because it was still a countryside atmosphere in the woods, but at the same time it was also a bit melancholic, a little sad and in the background there were the themes of deaths, in short, of elderly people, of grandparents who died from Covid and I feel a lot of melancholy for them."
DL049/DL049_night06.txt,"A sort of treasure hunt in which I had to find eggs that had been scattered in a maze and the feeling was not unpleasant, although I felt a feeling of increasing tension inside me."
DL049/DL049_night07.txt,"I was inside this ruined building where there were these small apartments and which were in short, in quite bad condition. And later after entering some of these, to see them as if I were going to buy one, I began to hear some familiar voices in a corridor outside one of these houses. Actually then I entered this type of alley, as if it were in a Moroccan town, so very lively, even if the atmospheres were always very dark and there I moved with these friends, with whom, however, there was not a particular feeling, in short, a good feeling. We were all very much each for his own. And then I found myself here under my house, the setting was very detailed and I was in the rain, without an umbrella or anything here where there is a public fountain. In practice I waited for my father but he didn't arrive, and at a certain point I went to turn on and off these lights of the Fountain and with some people around who were beggars, who made noises of appreciation or not based on whether I turned the light on or off. And then I was able to go over the little bridge that is here between [PLACE1] and [PLACE2]. And arriving at the height of the tobacconist of [PLACE2] I found my cousin [NAME1] and with him I stopped to chat about the pronunciation of some words."
DL049/DL049_night03.txt,"I was in a pine forest, in a park by bicycle and I was facing a climb, which I was working, I felt the physical effort, the breathlessness in tackling the path in front of me. And at a certain point I arrive in a sort of clearing with a sort of margin in front of me, around which more or less some people gathered, but not in a religious sense, it was almost as if it were a small monument to the forest. And at this point I perceived a feeling of lightness so I took off and this allowed me to have a bird's eye view, precisely on the clearing and in this way I saw my ex-girlfriend with a hypothetical current boyfriend. And from there my emotions turned into anger, into disappointment and the breathlessness that I felt just before, during the bike climb, became the breathlessness of anger. And at this point I took control of the dream and I approached, as if I were some kind of bird, a flying entity and I approached them and I wanted to say something to them to make my frustration clear. And the only thing I could say was: ""how cute"". Obviously it was in an ironic sense, but let's say, I tried to maintain a certain degree of diplomacy and I was aware of that."
DL049/DL049_night02.txt,"I was in a large hall of a beautiful hotel and I was viewing the dinner menu with my girlfriend. And on the menu there were notes inviting you to dine at times, let's say a little earlier than the standard times, so if you ate for example by twelve you were given two cups of gold. And if you ate by nineteen o'clock you were given two Japanese set-type cups. And shortly thereafter we took the order. Later came this dish, with a sort of sushi but made, that is, particular, instead of being like the classic nigiri, this was a much lower flattened rice ball, as if it were like a hamburger and on top there was a salmon tartare on one side and a smoked sea bass carpaccio on the other. And the waitress arrived to apologize for the mix-up, because instead of sea bass the second rice ball had to have tartare on top and I still told the waitress that I would taste. I tasted the sushi, let's say, with sea bass and I distinctly felt the flavor of the smoke and, also of the fish so, in short, I thought it was sea bass and a drop of lemon. And so I told the waitress that it was fine, that it was good too, that I would have preferred the salmon tartare, but still that this was fine too."
DL049/DL049_night01.txt,"I was in a room with a terracotta floor, large windows covered by curtains and in the environment it was very hot, it was as if there was an intense steam, almost like a sauna, even if the steam was not so strong. I was hunting a spider and while I was hunting this spider, which then eventually hid and I couldn't kill it, on the couch there were chefs Locatelli, Barbieri and Cannavacciuolo from masterchef, who, in short, were commenting on my phobia and my technique of catching the spider. And then I jumped into another room, there was a parrot with blond hair."
DL014/DL014_night08.txt,"In practice, I am in a business meeting that was held in the hotel where my family also came, in a tourist location, I think. And I thought I was going to meet a professor, but then there were many other people to meet and meetings, so I had brought only two clothes, one of which was a little more elegant and another a little less but both stained, and I didn't realize that they were dirty and therefore not being able to wear them, and since someone had pointed out to me that I had unsuitable clothing,  I go in search of a dress to buy in this large hotel that also had a supermarket inside. Anyway, first of all I decided to look for the room but they give me the number of a room, I go in and there is another person inside, a man who tells me that I made a mistake. So I go looking for another room and I don't find it because all the rooms are occupied, I leave the suitcase somewhere along with a green shoe, very bright with glitter, which I had found there. And then I go in search of this room but I don't find it. And in practice I manage to find the room after a kind of trial in which the person in whom he had put himself in this room is accused by the hotel manager of having improperly taken that room that was reserved for me. So I go in and I can put on a dress that, also green with glitter, sequins, very ugly, horrible. Then there is also a little girl who would be my daughter who wears the same dress, but obviously suitable for her and we leave the room together with these two horrible dresses, which really seem monstrous to us and then and we go to a ceremony but in short, no one comments on these two very ugly dresses."
DL014/DL014_night03.txt,"In practice, we had gone to a club and we were waiting to enter and we asked the staff if we could make a subscription because I went there very often. Anyway, once we have bought the tickets we enter this large terrace and the sun is eclipsed, it becomes dark. So I look out of the terrace and see the sea very agitated. So we move away for fear that these waves will come towards us. And instead at a certain point a huge ship arrives, full of Chinese or Asian soldiers with rifles drawn, which continues beyond the terrace. But the vision of this huge ship and all these soldiers was frightening, it was really shocking because there were so many people on this very long ship."
DL014/DL014_night04.txt,"I had gone to a stationery shop, a newsstand to buy a book by an author, a philosopher who was like an edition that came out on a weekly basis. And yet the young lady, in addition to making me wait a long time while I was there and there were other people too, wanted to give me an old book that was not what I wanted, like a high school textbook. So I, in short, was looking at this book when at a certain point she asks me if I can call my husband because he has back pain and would like messages, but I explain to her that these are more things for a physiotherapist, let's say, than for a doctor, but she insists on having him come at two o'clock. So I think my husband would have been angry about this appointment at two o'clock under the sun, getting to the newsstand. Then at a certain point my husband shows up but we are no longer in the newsstand, but in a meadow with many other people, all friends. And my husband had also taken my little son with him in a pram like those of newborns, who was sleeping, we leave him to these people, even if I was not willing to leave him and we go, we take the car, we venture down a broken road and I am afraid that we could get a puncture and therefore that we can no longer go home and get stuck on the road."
DL062/DL062_night09.txt,"A stage is basically a sort of three groups that alternated on this stage and that did different things, even related to the past, to antiques, something like that, ehm and that at the beginning shot each other in the foot and then instead they started working in synergy. I was part of one of these three groups, but in a secluded way, because then in fact I didn't go on stage. But maybe they were doing the organization, the behind the scenes, um, something that was probably about the organization, yes, and maybe after that I had managed to get them to coordinate. This white stage and this alternation on the stage."
DL062/DL062_night15.txt,"I had to go to Milan or I was in Milan, I was in Milan. And at one point I said: ""Well, look, I'm here, I'm almost going around, I see the shops"". So I said: ""Well, [MISS] so I'm going to go and see myself, er, these windows and so, I'm going to go into a shop too, I'm going to see some things to wear"", but like a brand that I usually take and only that cost like infinity, that is a dress nineteen hundred euros. And so nothing, I came away. 

I had to go somewhere, a field trip, some sort of school trip or, um, something, and I had to take the ship. I leave the store and then I leave from [PLACE1] and I find myself in the store at the last minute that some ladies come in and want to try things on, and I was already ready to leave. And so I said to him: ""Look, sir, I have to make you go away because I have a ship, otherwise I risk losing it"". ""Yes, don't worry, let's go away, don't worry, let's go away"". Kind by the way, without even being offended. ""Let's come back at another time, we know it's late"". It was like one and something. Uh too bad that when they go out, er, they are wrong and come out with a shoe, a sandal of theirs and a shoe of mine, from the store, and so, er, I have to resort to her and tell her: ""Look ladies but you went out with new shoes, one and one by the way, you are not ..."". "" Ah, he's right."" And so I chase them with their sandals, to be able to retrieve their shoes from the store. I manage to do this thing, but it's a pity that I'm very late to be able to get to the ship. So I call and I say, ""Look, I'm coming, I'm very late, er, I mean I'm going to be like uhm at one and two to one and three or two o'clock"", uhm anyway two or three minutes late, ""if anything tell the captain of the ship if he's waiting a moment because I'm coming, because then if I don't catch you to go to this place,  er, I don't know how to get there because there are no means"". And my friend says to me: ""No, the means are there"". I said: ""Oh well, then to the bad guys, if I really miss the ship, I'll come with the ship after and I'll join you"". So I said: ""We have found a solution"". 

And then at a certain point learning something new through, like the politics of a country, something like that, but through a piece of cake. That is, I ate a super chocolatey piece of mega cake eh, but this was used to learn like the politics of a country."
DL062/DL062_night01.txt,"I was in this house at [PLACE1], which is our house, blue and all, and friends would come and show them all the rooms and so on. But then at a certain point something happened so that the house burned down, they burned a piece of the house. And I said to my parents: ""But a piece of the house is burning"". And they told me: ""No but don't worry, don't worry, now the fires are going on"". And then these two firefighters were lit and actually burned, that is, made sure that the fire was extinguished, except in a corner where I went with a bottle of water in short. And in the meantime we also had animals in this house and so I had to move a small dog. And then there is a very dear friend of mine, I was talking to him and we were also in a place ... he had let's say this house in which in reality that was then interchangeable, er, he had it basically, er, all furnished with the things of the office and that were disused, and so he showed me that he had the megagalactic thing of the office eh, and then he had [MISS] some team building stuff. And so you had the place where you could punchball and where you could vent your anger, or you had another place where you could do things, and in short, it was a half between design stuff and useful things, like where to vent anger and where to vent nervousness and so on. Then like some of my friends that I showed the house to, a friend of mine who was sleeping, [NAME1], another one, [NAME2], who I showed them the house and I said it was very beautiful. In practice almost all the time I showed the house to show how beautiful it was, how cool it was eh. Then there was this hallucinatory fire."
DL062/DL062_night03.txt,"I was in a kind of hospital. I was in the hospital to be able to do blood tests to check my values. Erm, let's say that this hospital was a greenhouse hospital with all the plants, er, and this botanist friend of mine worked there and practically he was the one who then took the sample and so on. And it was a mixture of a people's hospital and a plant hospital. And nothing. This hospital where I went to take these samples for check-ups and the two people, um, let's say, in charge of checking my analyses, etc., actually looked a bit like two bosses, in short, two professors, a professor and her assistant, who are a bit, um, of the external bosses that we have at work now. And nothing, anyway the feeling was of this very large space with these plants and so on. Maybe someone locked himself in the elevator. 

And then of the paths. Perhaps a very long journey."
DL062/DL062_night06.txt,"Something that had to do with food, of delicious chocolates. Uhm uhm something that had to do with walking, doing things outdoors and eating out with these two friends of mine, [NAME1] and [NAME2]. These chocolates are delicious."
DL062/DL062_night07.txt,"At one point we were in a clearing of a village and my dad was also there, and we went to see a street artist who told stories that were mainly for children and were actually very good for adults too. And this story he told, very beautiful, looked a little bit like something about the film Pan's Labyrinth, and so anyway with this person, let's say, a half-satyr half-human person, in short, he was a bit of a mix. Ehm and there was a little girl with us, a little girl who couldn't follow this story because it scared her too much and because she was convinced that her parents didn't allow her to see it, so sometimes she ran away and sometimes she came back with this guilt of not being able to see the whole show, and then in the end she forced herself to see it all and it's as if at the end of the story she had grown up,  was bigger. And then, um, this guy here, then I started talking to him when I finally told him: ""No but this story reminds me a bit of a movie"" and I brought out this movie called like reversed love, of which I invented the whole plot.

A house to be fixed, on two floors, in which one floor was arranged and the other floor was to be arranged. But gradually it was arranged by my sister-in-law's parents, and then my brother-in-law and my brother also lived there. But it was bad, it was ugly, things didn't add up, in short, it was very problematic."
DL062/DL062_night05.txt,"There was [NAME1] on the island of Elba, [NAME1] is my ex-boyfriend and he had to leave, he had to leave. And he was in a room of the house on one side. And then he waited for someone to bring him but there were my mom and my aunt who made an endless phone call; They talked a lot about a specific topic, geese, and my dad who had to accompany him to the ship. But in short, he was in this separate room and I was angry with him and I went to talk to him and tell him: ""Of course you have to stop telling me lies"" and he started telling me that he loved me, that uhm that it's not true that he had told me and that the fact of using this machine,  That was the idea, it reminded him a lot of other things, because he had been loaned this car. And then after we moved on to load things on the ship or in any case people who had to enter a particular parking lot, to help these people to enter and exit this parking lot, which was a parking lot that was dismantled; uhm he would assemble a piece and then lower the ramp, then there were some kind of forks, blue supports for motorcycles, erm in short, a bit of a strange place. It's as if there was a big floor, a chessboard, at one point there was even a woman who had to clean this big floor, a sort of chessboard, something like that. Always very bright eh, very sunny."
DL062/DL062_night04.txt,"I was in this basic house all white and with several rooms, before I had a dinner with my friends of, let's say, housewarming. I had invited twelve thirteen people and in reality only three came, because I had forgotten that there was the European Championship match, and therefore people wanted to see the game. Ehm and so there was a whole part related to this dinner, to what we ate, er, and what I cooked, but not cooked because then I actually thought I was cooking but then I didn't feel like it, and so in the end I tried to do cold things, giving cold things and without going crazy too much. And then we were waiting for other people but who did not show up or in any case then they showed up, they came late. And when they arrived, I found myself with small pieces of raw meat to deliver, er, like carpaccio, raw meat in the sense of cured meats, but raw meat cured meats, so a bit like carpaccio and puddle beef, these things here. Um and I made the dishes, only they were always criticized and so, um, I always tried to make them prettier. In short, a somewhat difficult situation, that's it. And at one point my ex-boyfriend also arrives, who came to this dinner anyway. And nothing, we manage to talk a little, he doesn't tell me anything yet about why we broke up, why this thing happened, but we still manage to spend a little time together. At some point, we end up practically in bed together. And just when it seemed that we were starting to flirt, er, we were in an upstairs room, an actor comes along that I follow on Instagram, his name is Pierugo. Ehm and he comes and in short he tells me: ""No guys you have to move because this is my bed and you have to leave"". And so we take all our things and go away looking for another place. Um, anyway something like this happens again, um, so this guy slams the door and smashes it all, from white all the paint falls and becomes brown and lilac behind. And so, so I gather all my things again and go back to what used to be my room, because then I actually rented the part below this part of the house, where four of them slept, and I said to him: ""[NAME1] let's go upstairs, that's my room and no one says anything to me"". But actually there was really too much mess. And therefore this opportunity for communication in every sense has been lost. All this was because he then left for twenty days for Sweden for the Kungsleden route. My bike falling, er, this difficulty in dinner. Then at a certain point I also went to different bakeries and they didn't serve me, then I queued, then I moved the car, let's say a part of big difficulty in organizing this dinner and also lack of desire."
DL006/DL006_night11.txt,"It's like January, we are in a bare place with only the counter and maybe a couple of people but still empty and quite sad, let's say. And the next scene is that I got married to [NAME1] and I realize that I did something wrong and so I go to him and I say, ""but why did we get married."" And he tells me like: ""come on it was obvious that we were going to get married, and it's right that we are together, we are a beautiful couple"", something like that. And I kind of realize at that moment that he's like he's my father, somehow, I don't know if he kind of becomes my father or something. And I say to him: ""but you see, we can't get married because you are my father, you can't be my father and my husband at the same time"", and he says to me ""but why not?"". And I tell him ""no, it won't work, you'll see that within a week at most we'll break up"" but he is quite indifferent, let's say to all this, he doesn't react."

In the sense that you could see the city very far away and below there was Milan. I could distinguish between the different places. And on the one hand I thought I wanted to go there, let's say, to those places. But when I thought I wanted to go there I got dizzy. I got very dizzy because let's say that I put my leg on the other side of the wall and I had the feeling that I could have fallen and then I got dizzy and shivering. And with great caution, holding on to another column on the other side of the wall, I got off this wall. And at one point I met an Indian guy, I don't know if [NAME1], oh well anyway an Indian guy who at some point started talking to me. I was with [NAME2]. He started talking to me and I didn't understand what he was telling me. He talked to me, it was a lot, he wanted to say something nice to me. I think he stayed, I had remained sympathetic to him for some reason. And in short, I told him: ""repeat, repeat slowly"" because I didn't understand what he was saying in English. And at one point he just wanted to tell me that another guy had made the same joke to him that I had made him and this thing had made him laugh a lot all day."

So I tell them: ""they don't have to find us"", but after a while they start looking for us practically and actually it's not only those of [PLACE1] but there is also, surely there is [NAME4], there are a few people and then there is [NAME4], who is my best friend, and he starts shouting ""[NAME5]! [NAME5]!"" and [NAME1] answers and I tell him: ""no, you shouldn't have answered"" and [NAME4] comes and says and tells me: ""come on"", I don't know, he tells me that I have a beautiful voice, he tells me that I have a beautiful voice and [NAME1] says ""it's not true, there doesn't have a good voice""."

I help her. We find out what place eh it is the municipality of Boccia, province of Arezzo, and they send the application to participate in the competition and win. So I think that I too can try to participate and I also send the data to win a prize. I can't get in touch with anyone so I try to contact this municipality of Boccia to find out if I can win. So while my cousin wins and then they will give him his prize, I somehow try to get in touch with them to find out if I can get the prize too. And while I try to get in touch with them, I discover that the municipality does not exist. But I discover that there is a kind of police station with a sign outside that says ""police headquarters of the municipality of Boccia"". I go inside and while I try to talk to someone I am sent to a room where there are guys who are doing newspaper articles. I try to understand what kind of magazine it is and in trying to investigate I am kicked out. I am kicked out so I try to go around to understand where I am and where this Boccia is, if she really exists. I don't discover anything and in the end after going around various places, various streets in vain, I end up in the same place, I go back to this police station again, and I realize that in reality this is not a magazine, but it is simply, the one these guys were working on, but it was the electoral campaign of Al Gore candidate for President of the United States in the year 2000. And they are therefore campaigning for Al Gore which obviously makes no sense given that we are in Italy and that we are in the year 2000.

And so nothing, during this trip obviously there were various difficulties, we faced them and we defeated those who had to be defeated, until we arrived at a certain point at an island that seemed quite livable, where you could move this population, which was a population of a village, at which you went back to recover these people and guide them to this island.

DL008/DL008_night15.txt,"We are out with some acquaintances of mine somewhere. I have all my friends around sitting and we have a wooden stick, we are in a row sitting and the wooden stick sitting on our thighs, resting on our thighs and this wooden stick is quite flexible and we in addition to throwing things at each other, generically, like objects or water etc we try to bend it, how to say. This stick has this property that it can be twisted slowly. We do it and slowly yes so you shorten the stick, you reduce the length of the stick and as people make mistakes they are made fun of and people make mistakes in the sense that people provoke this, they have to be careful to turn the stick up to a certain point but it turns too much and causes the stick to break and is made fun of and insulted. Then an elderly person arrives who I know is the daughter of a very particular person who had come when I was in elementary school. He was a person who lived not far from my elementary school and knew some teachers, I don't know. It was a person who made wicker baskets, she had come to talk to us about this, this thing. That is, in the sense that he had sat there and described to us how these baskets are made, that is, precisely by folding the material, all this by weaving it and so on. This person, this very old daughter tells us that first we have to wet the wood, before twisting it, so at least it maintains flexibility. And it is the same phrase that he had said to us there at school, in the sense that I remember and I say ""ah it's true yes, I've already heard it"", in the sense that this person this old woman had described as one of the steps to work this. Here, let's just say that I realize that I have this knowledge. And we are there, at a certain point, it's true, at a certain point this, this stick is quite flat and gradually I break it, it gets shorter and shorter, at a certain point we turn it, we turn these pieces that we have picked up away let's say, that is, that we have, these pieces of stick that have formed we turn them and it's actually like a sandwich,  that is, how to say a tongue of bread, toasted and we can understand, to see the signs of the toasting on the bread that has now become in small pieces. A bread among other things that I say something like ""ah but here it's better"", it was also there, it was seasoned this bread, that is, in the sense that it made real sandwiches that were, people could eat and then it became this, this, this thing here that we were playing with, we were doing this strange thing and yet in reality now it is all broken up. Well at some point we are there like this, my paternal grandfather [NAME1] arrives and asks me in English how late it is and it is eleven in the evening. At the beginning, that is, just before, we are like in a store, it is tied up, it is all on a single, we are in a store, that is, I realize that before I am there with my friends to do this thing with this strange object and play in this way, we are in a store that is like a grocery store that sells everything and we can buy,  or rather I'm choosing to buy things, ok, as if we were in a video game, that is, as if I bought equipment in a video game, a bit strange, in the sense of, I can choose between very strange equipment and also, from weapons to vehicles, to stuff just more than food, that is, I can choose in a way, wide choice. I pass over guys, gods, a helicopter, a car, a motorcycle, like things like that, then weapons but anyway then I don't choose anything. There is an elderly person who tells me that I am doing something useless, that I had to go. In fact, then it's all a sort of video game, in the sense that I have this interface here with the joystick type to move, but it seems real in reality, I have this double perception that I'm playing this video game but in reality it's reality, I'm playing the video game in the sense that I have this reality on a screen,  something like that, that is, I look at a precise point, I look at a particular point in the world around me to focus on this scene, this choice, this shop, and so on. Actually, it's as if I were sitting at the TV, it actually seems real, that is, that I am using the joystick but this joystick, the cable of this joystick, ends up in the real world, in the sense that there is no screen in front of me, there is reality, I am sitting in front of this reality anyway, that is, I am sitting and how to say the joystick ends up against the counter of the store where I am choosing things and I use the joystick to choose them. There is a person next to me who says ""no anyway fast, we have to go, you are doing useless things, we have to go"" and at a certain point I start driving with the joystick, moving the joystick among other things a bit randomly, in the sense turning it in my hands, as if it were, that there are darts then on one side there is the position and on the other of,  There are two sets of buttons, of buttons that I can press, one to move, to move a motorcycle that I am riding to go to the hospital. And I ride this bike as if it were really a playstation game, totally, where you can do whatever you want, let's say, where you move randomly. I had to take one person to the hospital. Nothing happens, in the sense that I have this bike that I'm riding in the game that I realize there has something of reality, in the sense that I really had to take this person to the hospital but I use this bike inadequately, in the sense that I ride it badly. I go against the walls, against, to cut the road, get to the hospital first, I cut, yes I go against the walls, through what seem to be like flower beds, I go through flower beds, I go against bushes, trees. Anyway, I don't really pass on the road to shorten the route and get to the hospital. This is a part of the previous dream, I don't remember if I get to the hospital, in the sense that I am there moving, it seems to me that the person with me is gradually a little worried and frustrated but in reality we who are, at least me. This other person that I had to take to the hospital, that I, who are driving virtually through the joystick, are sitting next to us, watching TV and I have this perception, nothing happens to us, we can like to say, we can move like this, we can do the path, crash in the video game, but in reality I am really taking this person to the emergency room. And so in fact I realize that the person next to me is fed up that I how to say is wasting time and I have to go on the road, ride this bike well so that she gets to the hospital at some point without, she is worried let's say, so there is this, how to say this passage between reality, this confusion between virtual reality that I don't understand there and then what,  Where he is, to what extent I can play, to what extent I can, I actually have to do these things, that is, these tasks, I have these urgencies so bring this person, get there and so on. I'm not sure what my grandfather says in English, it seems like something like ""how much is it"" but I'm sure he's asking me, there's a late then at some point, he's asking me how late it is just in the way, in English, asking me like how much it actually costs,  how much it is, like. I understand that you mean how late it is. Then maybe at some point he says late, too. I don't know, I look at my watch, which is the one I generally have on my wrist. Yes."
DL008/DL008_night11.txt,"Something happens that is linked to a hospital or something like that, a situation of let's say of a problem for which you return from the hospital. And in the scene it's me, there's my mother, some of my mother's friends, especially an adult woman and a child, and my cousin [NAME2], then my mother, so basically there are four of us. We return to my house, my parents' house to [PLACE1]. This child on the basis of, shows me a story, a theme, an ashtray, a small pocket book, like a Bignami in which, with the blue cover in which he printed an essay or a story that he wrote on request let's say at school, he goes to elementary school and they asked him to write this story on behalf that I at a certain point ask him if it is his story,  as if to say, it turned out, I start from his imagination completely or he was somehow guided in the deliveries and so on. And he tells me: ""no, I invented it all"". A story that in some ways recalls the plot of My Brilliant Friend, a TV series. This is a bit of the background, the plot, the beginning and I read the first few lines of two pages, one two pages, they are three guys who love each other. Three guys who love each other but one is not reciprocated compared to the other so there are let's say affections, emotional dimensions that are not reciprocated, they are forced to stay in a room, how to say, kidnapped. So the story starts with this scene and describing the situations of these three. At a certain point I continue to read and I am, I realize that there are grammatical errors, errors not of punctuation but of non-punctuation from a narrative point of view, it is unclear, it is a bit confusing. But anyway I say oh well it's a child who is next to me, this child actually while I'm reading. A little further on are my mother, this friend of my mother, that is, the mother of this child, who are there. I read this story and I feel a bit like it growing in me, that is, this child knows that I like to write, and how to say he admires me, he sees in me how to say a figure who can give him first of all satisfaction if I read his product, on the other hand perhaps also advice, that is, I feel this role, this responsibility,  this admiration on the part of the child, even perhaps on the part of his mother. And so I read the story quite carefully with the idea of actually telling him something, helping him in this, if he had this desire to write and so on. And this writing has become something real, print a booklet, as much as it may be something like that, there and then, anyway it's a nice thing and so I want to encourage it and so on. I read, I continue to read, at a certain point suddenly, that is, I feel a certain restlessness, a certain difficulty, a. That is, at a certain point the child cries, is sobbing and the people present take it out on me, that is, they tell me they are telling me something, that is, they are reprimanding me for something that I have done or should have done differently. So at a certain point I feel responsible for the baby's crying and how to say that I encouraged him or encouraged him to do something when in reality I shouldn't have. So the baby is now crying. At a certain point the adults present, my mother and the mother of this one of mine, take it out on me, pointing out a behavior that is not good therefore that I should not have had and that if I had had it differently the child would not have cried etc. I realize perfectly well that it is an absurd thing, that is, that it has nothing to do with the fact that the baby is crying or with the story. It is something related to writing anyway always. That is, as if I had somehow deluded him, something like that, oh well. While I am, to which they actually, the mother of this scolds me for something that literally has nothing to do with the rest, with what is happening, for which I do not feel responsible at all. At some point I realize that while I'm telling these people that they're saying something absurd and it's completely unrelated to what's going on. I hear my mother telling me ""oh well, I hope you're leaving, how to say, get out of the way, you're making the situation even worse, it's incredible that you still think you answer how to say you think you're on the right side, despite this"", the baby is crying, sobbing, continues to cry and sob,  I reply to my mother ""of course, yes I'm leaving"", I start to take my personal belongings. There is a wallet, some keys, they were on the table, a black wallet. And in the meantime I'm moving away with the thought, the child is somewhere, with the thought, however, of saying to this child ""good, it's a nice story"", I feel that I'm getting moved by this feedback I'm giving, that I want to give to the child because I realize that it's a feedback that can be useful to him,  Despite this result, this reproach that I am receiving in some way is connected, but who cares. In the sense that I care, I am interested in this child and in telling him what is happening, I mean what happened and whether to continue or not, if in the story and so on, that is, the value of this writing, if it is something that he likes to continue it freely and that it was a very good thing, a very nice thing that he had done,  Until the time of rereading I at a certain point say: ""Hell I have to tell the child to reread that story over time and to fix the points and deepen them, others maybe to see them again, which is a very nice thing and to continue like this because it is beautiful, because it is very beautiful"". And I'm undecided whether or not to ask the child to let me give me this story to continue reading it and do it, point out some things that are wrong and then give him more complete feedback, or to leave him the story, so that he can remain with this piece of something done well, that is, that he can feel satisfaction in seeing it. All this goes through my head as I am walking away. But at a certain point I have this other image of one, not of a corridor, of a fairly small room, the entrance to a house is probably the entrance, probably now it is at the entrance to this the apartment where I then find these people. There is a door. So it is a fairly poor entrance as it were, unkempt and not very well cared for, there is this detail of a lock, of a key that turns, the old ones let's say, a lock with a key, enough, not too much, which is not used today. That is, a key of those that are a bit long, a bit old, and so on. So and you can't see the door, that is, this key and this lock and the structure of the door, which is white, kind of delicate, not really not too much attention to detail but that loses color, like the things that when I was in kindergarten, that is, the doors of elementary school, or kindergarten, that is, the doors that were there at the time, twenty years ago like,  a bit old, which make a noise as if it were there, those doors that have a glass window at a certain point, from the middle upwards for example and that when they close and open they make that glass noise because, not correctly, how to say, arranged, not correctly fixed, so the glass moves minimally and you feel this,  the sound of the door closing, etc. with the dadan behind. Anyway I have this I have this sound, this image I like to say I enter and then I find the scene. However, I move away from the place and it ends like this."
DL055/DL055_night12.txt,"There was a guy, I found him on the street, like in a very strange parking lot. And he told me that he wanted to study medicine and so I accompanied him, like to a kind of open day in a place that was actually as a structure... It was a high school. Apparently there was the open day of medicine there. 

I was with some friends and we went dancing in a very strange place that was like in an attic, which was made of steps like ups and downs. The roof was very low and they were like tunnels. And so I had to walk all bent over."

DL055/DL055_night14.txt,"I had to retake the high school exam or, in short, it was a via. But boh implied that of maturity and I didn't want to do anything, I didn't want to study.

That is, very badly morally, that is, that I did not commit myself to it, I was wrong. And there was not my school, there were no my classmates, except one. And there were the nurses of the current ward where I work, then a cousin of mine. And yet in the end, since I had always been committed, apparently, over the years, etcetera etcetera, they didn't give me a grade, a bad vote, I got like eighty-five, so I said: ""ah okay ok, it went well anyway""."
DL016/DL016_night13.txt,"I walk on the walls of [PLACE1] uhm something connected to a medicine or a drug. Then I go to a house, maybe [NAME1's] house, and there's a room with a man who had some problems where he couldn't walk and then he was healing so he walked a little bit. Then there was a secret door where [NAME2] was hidden. For some reason we decided that we had to run away because they wanted to kill us or take us prisoner. So there was a little door in the back in the room, uhm, which wasn't very conspicuous, and so I was hiding in [NAME2] and so when the owner of the house, uhm, came in, uhm, the idea was to tell him something, so this person would go into the room, so he wouldn't catch it, I mean. But then while we were talking this little door opened by mistake and then he saw this room and went to check then while he went to check we ran away and started running and we ran and we ran into a botanical garden, we went out, so then this room was in the basement let's say, we went back up we came out of maybe a window, we didn't know where the exit of this house was,  then we would go out the window and start running into the garden. Ehm so we arrived in this garden ehm climbing over things, but moving a bit randomly because we didn't know where the exit of this garden was so we ran uhm we practically arrived at a kind of wall so we deviated a little to the right, I jumped over some bushes, I arrived at this wall and I ended up in a kind of botanical garden let's say with a pond so I started running in the middle of these ponds,  these water things, it got darker and darker the place and eventually pretty much the wall on the left kept growing bigger and bigger uh until then at some point we came to a ladder, I would go up it and at the top of this ladder there was a door, I would open it uhm and nothing I could get out, and at that point you had to wait for the person I was driving out so that I was running away that [NAME2] just or maybe my mother at that point had become, oh well, and I let her out. So we were out in a city on this road at night uh with locals, so this person who was just my mom would go out, uh I would look at the sky and there was a plane or some kind of rocket that first took off and then I would see it from a distance that is before it had this very vertical trajectory let's say,  and then it began to have a descending trajectory so it scared me a little because I thought I had seen, let's say the plane fall, but only in the first part so let's say, er, I thought I had witnessed the plane crash but only in the initial part. But I imagined that in any case the plane would have fallen in the next hidden part of the buildings, in the part of the horizon that was hidden by the buildings. Then there was the issue with this plane, there was a question related to sending rockets in the sky, and a bit of the traps in short seems a bit dangerous and disturbing to me. Then there was something, something related to a dog, perhaps, and then something related to a drug."

Uh... and I'd recommend the nicest beaches and they'd say they were a little annoyed that the water was murky, and then we'd go, and then there'd be a question about a bottle of Coca-Cola.

I think Prometeia, tells me ""ah, they hired me, they pay me seven hundred and fifty euros a month"" and I said ""okay, I mean, ok"". And there was [NAME1].

DL027/DL027_night10.txt,"I was with some colleagues and we were studying the start-up phases of two programs, we were trying to understand how to improve them because in both cases they were a bit slow, a bit convoluted, and so we were there doing test after test and we can't come to a valid conclusion, and we were a bit demoralized, let's say. We studied, we tried, but nothing, the result did not come, in the sense that nothing ever changed, these programs started but always with these same problems that we could not solve."
DL027/DL027_night14.txt,"My colleague had called me and was looking for something on my computer, I was on vacation and she was at work in the office, she was working on my computer. He was looking for a specific file in the folders of my computer, but he couldn't find it, so he wrote to me, sent messages, etc. At a certain point she doesn't find him, I explain to her where to find, where to look and she doesn't find him. And at a certain point she gets angry and sends me to that country on whatsapp. So I write to him ""look but I don't understand"" and I write you the absolute path of this folder, where to look for this thing. I send it to her on whatsapp and she doesn't answer me anymore. Then after I go you talk to us: ""sorry but how come you didn't find it? Oh, that's the folder"" and she doesn't answer. And I stayed there like this, that I tried to explain this thing to her, or rather I tried to write the exact name of this folder on the computer and she seemed not to understand or not want to understand, and so she left me a little dumbfounded. And then immediately after I see two children in front of me, in two different moments, two children, never seen, strangers, and I see some children, who are touching each other's dick, both of them and there boh I remain like this, of the serious boh they are fa', and then who knows these children."
DL027/DL027_night09.txt,"I had given a Christmas gift to a colleague, and at one point I asked her if she had received it because I had sent it to her by courier, in short, I had sent it to her home, and then I asked her: ""but listen, but did you receive anything from the courier?"" and she said: ""oh yes, a package arrived but I sent it back because I didn't know who it came from"",  And I said to her: ""Sorry, how did you send him back? Was it something you didn't like, that you weren't interested in?"" and she says: ""no yes eh I could also like it but I chose to refuse it, because I don't want to receive gifts"". And I was so upset, I said but how, then I explained to her and so on that she came to me, that I sent it to her and she at a certain point says to me: ""no but yes come on I was joking, yes, I understood that you were sending it and I accepted it very willingly, among other things a very nice gift"". And so at a certain point I recovered because I was really very sorry, since there was also a talk of friendship behind it, and then it also seemed quite offensive to me."

Ehm we were practically on a kind of holiday so to speak in Puglia or in any case in a part of the coast, somewhere, I don't know if in Italy or in another country. We slept in this kind of tent-type, like the gigantic circus tents. Ehm and the part I remember most is that one morning, yes we were in Italy because I spoke Italian, and one morning they were sleeping. In short, I wake up before them and go to look for a place alone, to walk the streets of the city looking for a place to have breakfast because I was hungry. Uh and nothing, and I couldn't find a place that did breakfast, all over, er, it must have been the period, er, tourist boom, because there was nowhere to have breakfast. And I entered this, by the way at random, completely at random, blindly, so with the possibility of getting lost because, oh well. And I didn't go into a bar and in this bar, er, it wasn't a bar it was like, uhm, it looked like those American places where they do like, uhm, breakfast and catering, er, elegant, it wasn't an Italian pastry shop. And there was this kind of chef guy out telling me they ran out of stuff. I saw some people, there were people, before I had asked some people who were walking around. Ehm and then nothing, disconsolate, er, I start walking again and I actually find myself in the starting point, and in reality I thought I was going to a point and I was completely disoriented and I was back in the point of origin."

Then while we were walking at a certain point she passed by and we went to greet her. Then [NAME2] went and touched his belly, but we had to be quiet because otherwise we would disturb the labor phase. Then from there I went around, there was a landscape, where we were walking, where we were there was snow. And I went to say hello to an old neighbor of mine, [NAME3], she was in this place, it was a place I had never seen. And so we went to say hello to her and she at one point put us in the waiting room because she had to go to the old darkroom when they did x-rays. And then I looked out, in fact there was that smell of acid that is in those rooms."

DL021/DL021_night06.txt,"It was about me who went to football and there is a whole part before. Oh well, there's a whole part before, and then oh well, I'll come, there's a whole part before where we're like secret agents and there's this part where there's this guy who is practically on the edge, with a fishing rod poised on a crevasse on a thing at the sea, and all naked, with everything from outside. Ehm it's with a fishing rod and this fishing rod with the line and so on goes all the way down the sea which is pretty high where it is uh and apparently how to say it got caught in a person's head and he doesn't anything, that is, in the sense of the ball, the rod is stretched but he doesn't care about the fishing rod. And then nothing and then eh at a certain point he wakes up and then starts pulling but when he realizes that he has taken how to say a human being, someone's head goes back to sleep. And then she had it, she had also taken the hair of a girl, of a woman and so this girl pulls everything until with this hair it doesn't go, it doesn't come off a hook and so on, from the line. He calmly went back to sleep and he just doesn't give a damn, poised on this thing. And I'm there, kind of as a spectator or a tourist, perhaps. There are two girls nearby, two girls. And nothing initially they are all like disgust, so, this one naked with the fishing rod etc., poised on the crevasse. But then at a certain point one of the two says ""ah but"" no he then gets up, the guy he gets up. And nothing, like he has this face a bit of a stoner, I would say, a little confused. Oh well, the girls say in the end ""damn but he's a bully."" That is, bullies like them, this is the conclusion I come to, that bullies like them. The technique of how to say, taking everything off is called ""being a zebra"". He is zebra. And nothing then, then he settles in this office and nothing I start talking for a while with the girls, let's talk about the fact that they say ""damn, but there is someone who hangs on the crevasse, so, it must be just a, that is, understood you have to have two balls like that"". And nothing so they are all a bit taken. Then we also talk about his penis, basically how big he had it, and another girl, the other girl who is nearby who hears us talking says ""ah but this is an interesting topic!"". Er, and she adds, all caught up in this topic. Ehm and I was saying and then there's this place that could be like a place where the police are, like or office like with various desks, and so this one here, this bully, eh that just makes an impression, ehm comes here in this office. Ehm I ask him if, how to say, he managed to sleep with those girls there, ehm he says yes. But I know it's not true. But in fact they liked it. Ehm and then there's this girl, I think Chinese. She has never done, I mean, she has been in prison for twenty years to say, and we give her one of those chocolate cakes from the Coop, so from the Esselunga type, and there is her who sniffs it all, and I tell her to sniff. And then he has never eaten it so he throws himself open-mouthed on this chocolate cake, and if he eats it all, he leaves just two slices. Before that, we are on a bus. And before that I smoked a lot of cigarettes while we were listening to music, I don't know what place, I was lying on the floor like that. And this tall guy, he was like a friend of mine for a short time. Tall, handsome, and rather big. And I made jokes about how tall and big he was, but he told me that it wasn't me, that it wasn't him, let's say the anomaly, no. And he threw the joke back at me in a way, and oh well I laughed at it, I didn't take it, just easy, really. Ehm like this, then we are in front of a middle school, which is now like a high school. All these people here from I don't know what association must arrive to protest. Yes, anyway the Chinese woman at some point starts to be a secret agent like me, like the future, ehm we are all identified in some way in a certain way, and we like put ourselves in a wheelchair and then there are a whole series of identifiers, like a belt put on the first hole. Then eh other things that we put on, clothes that are needed precisely so that they understand that you know and can contact you to become a typical secret agent. Then in the future and we are at this table and we eat in this restaurant of things, and we are like four friends plus this Chinese girl. And oh well, at some point this topic comes up of what happened at some point in two thousand one hundred and ninety-seven. Ehm that is, now the economy can expand exponentially because like energy sources have become more, and space has become colonizable. And in fact outside the window for a moment I look and there are all these, how to say, mini-spaceships that dart along a bit everywhere like futuristic, so they have unlocked like the possibility of indefinite growth ehm and nothing. And me and this Chinese woman here, this Chinese girl, we do explorations, like missions. And in one of them they are a type of game at the kitchen table. It has to do like with inspecting eh buses, bathrooms, other places that then you have to make a sort of report of these places, this girl is a bit changeable, that is, she is female but sometimes she changes, like she is no more, sometimes she could even maybe sometimes she could even become male at some point. However, let's go back to the football team. And precisely the football team, this field on which we train, which is that of the [INSTITUTION1], completely without grass the field but there is a thin net on one side of the field, so even if it has rained a lot you can run well on the field, it is not heavy, there is no mud and so on while if you go to the other side you notice the other side of the field,  you realize just how heavy the field is, so everything muddy because of the rain. And then we go, I go to the locker room with these other two friends and so on, and I take things off and wait to be able to take a shower in a way. And but well then at some point this guy comes out then, but then there is someone who steps on my things without wanting to because oh well I simply put them there near that shower and I say ""no but don't worry there's no problem"". And in all this there is also a coach, who always wakes up with, there is training would be at seven, eight. But how to say everyone said it's fine, in the sense, on the fact that it's like saying it has become common that at half past eight at the end you meet and in the end the coach who maybe is me then thinks okay four hours of training is enough I would say."

And I tried to combine all this various information to understand where the evil came from.

DL021/DL021_night09.txt,"Ehm it's me going towards the sea, a long road at the end of which there is the, there is a bathing establishment, like [PLACE1], ehm or rather I think it is [PLACE1], and there is this old man who goes very fast on foot and I am behind him on foot. And we don't know each other, actually. But I follow him, like this. Erm and nothing. At a certain point he tells me ""now I cross and do this"" and it's like the forty-eight establishment we enter, and I have to go to the end of the walkway and then go to the right towards my bathroom which is like fifty-two, towards my classic establishment. Ehm and then I enter at forty-eight with the old man. It seems to me that the old man is going too fast, I feel out of breath. While I almost chase him we say a couple of things, he says, I say ""well this is a perfect time"", which are like four o'clock to get to the sea, and the sun was already setting, in reality, warm but without the scorching sun. Ehm he says ""yes but even two o'clock"" and I say ""yes it's true come on even two o'clock is a nice moment, ehm you take a bath directly at two so you can cool off""."
DL021/DL021_night08.txt,"I'm going to this park with another guy. We are on a bicycle and I run into him with the bike and it is something that has already happened like ten times before. But this time and it is an entrance this new park, in which I was never, I had never done. Um, the guy is a high school friend of mine, an old high school friend of mine named [NAME1]. Nothing, I drop it and it stays there on the ground for a while. So I ask him if, how are you, and he makes me that it goes badly, otherwise he would already be up. And he also told me about a group of dogs perhaps, who were in this park, who had recently been born, they were like strays er, then this policewoman arrives, who has to give me a fine for making my friend fall, I tell the truth, I tell what happened, I also say what I asked him if he was fine or if he was sick,  I say that I didn't do it on purpose, in short. Then there are these bathrooms, this is an entrance to a park, and nothing is a very nice park. Actually there at the beginning it is a bit dirty, there is a bit of waste but then inside it is much cleaner than in other areas of this park. Just a new entry that we have found. And and nothing then, then there are these bathrooms that are quite clean. But my grandmother enters it, in one of these bathrooms, and says ""yes well because you are males, in short, you have to, it's different, we have to use the tablet."" Ten out of twenty, he says, you find animals, bugs, things that go around in the bathroom, no. Ehm in all this then at some point I have to play a game of chess. This chess game is for a tournament, like. And I have the impression that it is a second game, that is, that I am resuming a game and that this is a second game, and I find this small group of people that I had already seen, and who are also waiting there to play a game, there are various people, various of various ages, of various nationalities too. And nothing, I'll stop there, there are these two girls, and then there are guys who... There is one of them is one of my college mates, one of my former college mates, uhm er, nothing are all trained in particularly important chess gyms, these I say, while I take a lot of shawl actually in this dream. So I say, that is, in the sense, whether he wins or not in the end matters little. At one point they call me to play football, two against two, with two lesbian girls and another girl with whom I have to be with. Uh and nothing they score a lot of goals, like at some point we are thirty-six to twelve for them. And nothing, like that. Before that, it was all with my mother. We are, my mother's partner is also there. And we are, they are there too, we go to the car. Erm, this is a path that I have already taken. It's the one I did before. Not the one I'm doing now, in short, the one I did before to get to the park where I then made that friend of mine fall with his bicycle, which had already happened many times. And there was an old man who had stopped, he was a gentleman who was quite mature, let's say, but not old. And nothing this gentleman wanted to lend us his bike, he was a cyclist, he, his son was a professional cyclist. He says that he too sometimes happens to make others fall without wanting to, making the two wheels meet. There is also, we are going towards the car. I have already crossed and I am in another traffic light, shortly after, and instead she takes another road to go straight. And she tells me that I have to take all the stuff that has been put in the washing machine, washed, and take it down, she says in the cellar to iron, to iron it, and nothing I say ""but no, that is, in the sense I don't want to iron it, I don't do it"", and then I also talk about the fact that I try to spend as little time as possible on material matters,  eating, dressing, etc. At that point I'm also moving out of my room. I'm going to put a sleeping bag and some things in the room. But that is, how to say this, this transfer is not that I feel bad about this thing, on the contrary. I'm quite arrogant, I'd say, what's it, quite easy, I don't take it, and nothing then in the end I don't transfer all this stuff to the theater. We're at a dinner, my mom, me, some people from [INSTITUTION1]."

And he put [PLACE2] on and we had to go to [PLACE3], and instead of going to the highway, the navigator made us take a thousand different roads, go back, go forward, we passed through this town with tables outside, we walked along a river for a stretch, we climbed up these hill roads, with like these uhm like rock things sticking out above and below the road. We rode a lot, it wasn't particularly annoying even if after a while I got because we couldn't find the way. And I said ""oh well now let's put another navigator because this one is obviously shit"", even if it was Google's."
DL017/DL017_night05.txt,"We were at the research meeting of my old research group at [PLACE1], and one of the researchers who is actually a mathematician was presenting his future studies and showing a study where there were two two tasks, one where you had to find a word based on a definition, that is, based on the definition given to two or three other words,  and the other in which you had to find the word, the same word, among the letters that were scrambled between them. And he wanted to buy these two things here and he presented them with slides, I was sitting in the audience and I was discussing other things with an old colleague of mine and when he came back to the audience I proposed to him, that is, I asked him how he could compare these two experiments since they are two let's say completely different cognitive aspects, that is, in one you go to do a motor aspect of movement and the letters in the other, it is instead an aspect of pure memory, of pure association. And he was getting a little upset. He was making fun of me about this thing here and me while between me and him there was [NAME1] who is another researcher who good-naturedly teased me by saying ""here you see you made the mathematician angry""."
DL017/DL017_night02.txt,"We were crossing a pass that was [PLACE1] even though it actually had a much more Austro-Hungarian look. Coming down this pass there were statues that we recognize as ugly statues, basically, er, we slipped into a series of paths. And then we would go out under this Austro-Hungarian castle that was supposed to be the base of the pass to get back on the road. It was snowing, and we passed in these lanes following the road of the car even if we were on foot and several times we said to each other ""no then we are going to get stuck, yes, you must definitely follow the road of the car"". And along the pass there were all these really ugly statues, like neoclassical but of a very dark material, it could be a black marble, a granite, a basalt, something like that. And among these statues stood out a statue with two golden horns. So in the middle of all these neoclassical statues there was this molded statue, like a devil, a stuff like that, like goats let's say with these two very evident golden horns. And nothing, in one of these lanes where we had descended to go to the base of the pass they stopped us to take a photo from a nice view but we couldn't do it because my cell phone got stuck, uh before because when I tried to take a photo it was set to the selfie, to the self-timer. Then when I turned it around, the camera was blocked so I had to remove something that I had put in the cursor from the cell phone in front of the camera. At that point that glimpse was passing, too many people were no more, no, it was no longer day, it was night, snowfall and therefore it was no longer possible to take this photo."
DL017/DL017_night15.txt,"We were with friends on holiday in the south, perhaps in Puglia or Sicily. We arrived at this hotel, a large hotel with large staircases inside, but absolutely family-run, that's it, and we went to pick up to settle in the room, then they gave us courtesy cars that could be unlocked, however, with cards, even if they were old cars, just in size, of old structure, uh white, with the green writing of the hotel next to them,  and they gave us these keys with which to unlock them, with us to use as a courtesy car to go around the city, we took them, parked them not far from the hotel and went to the theater even if we actually went to dinner. We ate a lot, we divided the bill, and for me and my girlfriend it was seventy euros, seventy-two euros, but also, I have in mind a list that he made those things we had eaten at the checkout. And then we went out and the cars had been taken away, and in the meantime, while we were looking for the cars, finance arrived and did not seem particularly worried about the cars but only asked my friends for a sort of balloon test. So I went back to the hotel to say this thing about cars and my girlfriend was sitting at the hotel bar eating a crepe, I was a little angry with her. Er, I go to the hotel reception, and I said ""look, our car was stolen"" and I was very contrite I must say, very sorry. And they burst out saying ""oh well, now let's take a satellite shot and find the car, it's the one with the green stripe next to it"", and if not a friend calls us tomorrow and says ""asshole look you left the car around, it's here"" and then they bring it back to me, end of the matter. And this relieved me a little bit of the question of machines. So I would go back to my girlfriend and tell her ""look, they told us this stuff about cars"" and I go to tell the others to see if they have problems with finance. I went out again and took this road that led from the hotel to the sea, even if it was an uphill road so it could not lead to the sea, logically, but in reality it was in this square, where we had parked the cars, and there was the sea."
DL017/DL017_night01.txt,"I was talking first with my mother and then with my father about the road to take. Um, my mother used to talk to me about passing by a certain place possibly to see uh a concert in which there had to be an ex of hers, if I was interested or not and then my father told me that to pass uhm from there you had to take an alternative road on the bridge that crosses the Po to go from [PLACE1] to [PLACE2] in short, on the bridge of [PLACE2] that is, stay on the right and then turn at the height of the bridge,  in fact already on the bridge, he told me to take that road there. There were cars, I was inside the car, while the first part, the one in which I discussed with my mother, was done at a bar where my mother read a newspaper with other people and saw this thing written directly in the newspaper."

And there were simple patterns on thin tapes and then much more complicated patterns on other tapes. Even a ribbon I was Zelda themed uh they were all characters in different costumes, like workers' clothes, camouflaged clothes. Then it was like I was watching TV and in the beginning there was a cartoon, Steven Universe, and uh and it was Steven fighting some fire creatures but he didn't take him seriously enough, so Garnett would scold him. Then it went on to be My Hero Academy with the character of the little girl who tried to fight, but it wasn't enough, she couldn't do it. And then the character of the rabbit, who actually had a healing power that goes there, cures her and puts her back on her feet. And so he tells her to be strong. And then there is a dad of mine who is complaining about the fact that last time he saw the cartoon the character of the little girl was much stronger and I told him: ""But the enemies are not as strong"". Uhm and then I'm watching a comedy with a blond man with a crooked nose who did the Crodino commercial. Ehm this actor doing something and then finally drinking tea."

So push and pull, look towards the street, look towards the stairs, the stairs are free and these dog snags had left the stairs, all full of pee and we were frustrated with these dogs because they were the neighbor's dogs and they always peed on the stairs."
DL086/DL086_night11.txt,"At [PLACE1] there are organized trips to go fishing in those parts, more than anything else it was that they fished, they collected molluscs scattered around. Ehm this beach was a small strip of stones and gravel ehm on one side there was the sea and then, as soon as this strip of gravel ended there were very high rocks, like a rock wall. It therefore seemed like something stuck, a beach stuck between the rocks. Ehm then this is the first time I've gone and it's nice and then a second time I want to go ehm then I'll organize myself with my friends and we get there, me and a friend of mine and there's no one. So, my friend enters a Telegram chat that turns out to be that of fishing, he notices that all the messages that are there last a certain amount of time and then disappear and including a message from my mother who, in some way, entered that group and told me: ""Someone be careful to..."",  In short, someone protect me, something like that. And only my friend read that message and I didn't, I was sad because we hadn't gone fishing. Uhm uhm there were still messages in this group that said: ""Oh yes, today fishing canceled, no it's gone"" ehm for bad weather, it was just a bit cold. Ehm then then I went back to my house and I kind of had a fight with mom and we both raised our voices and now I was like, ""You can't get into that chat!"" I wasn't particularly upset about the message. Ehm she replies: ""But I worry about you!"". ""But you can't get into that one!"" ""And why can't I go in?"" ""Because they can hack you on that chat!"". I was really convinced of this thing, I was really angry that he didn't want to listen to me. And she says, ""I don't care!"" uh and that's it. Ehm after that we go to the supermarket together uhm and there is the fish section with the ""do not cross"" strip and an ordinary guy in front who reminds people not to cross which is very funny because behind there is a big pile of unfrozen fish. Ehm this is because previously the freezers, the ones open to expose the fish there, did not work, like the light above was not on and so now they have been removed and all the fish on the ground. Um, there are two of these fish corners next to each other. One works, but there is very little ice and usually the fish is exposed on the ice: there is very little of it and it is on aluminum. We don't buy fish and we approached the bakery and then mom asks me to choose a type of bread and it's very difficult. It's difficult because there are varieties, but you can't figure out which is the name of which, what is the price of which. Uh at a certain point I notice that mom has the receipt in her hand, as if she had already paid for the groceries. Ehm then I look at her and she says, ""[NAME1], go envelope."" I panic, but in total panic because we have already bagged. Thing? We have already paid, I don't understand. So I start running to all the tills from the inside uh to try to figure out what my mother's shopping is and I don't understand it. So I go out, run to the outside and still still don't understand it. The speakers are so many uh and I still can't figure it out. Erm and they are put in a strange arrangement, they start with a semicircle and then continue straight and then there are one, two, many and in the end run forward, run back, it was cash register number two. Ehm and there is a glass between the end of the crate and where I am and then mom has reached that crate and all calm looks at me, smiles at me, greets me. Ehm I'm very angry that she left all the groceries there. And then I approach the glass and I bang my hands against the glass and I rest my head against the glass, with an angry expression I look at her through the glass and then I leave it alone and walk away, I am walking towards another store. Um, I'm walking to this other store and I'm a little angry, I'm a bit like that. And a former high school classmate joins me and approaches me: ""Hi [NAME1], how are you?"", me: ""everything is fine"". And I notice that I'm walking all over with my hump, with my hands in my pockets, my expression angry so I tell her: ""Ah yes, I'm a bit tired because yesterday I went fishing. I went fishing"". I lied because I wanted to make myself beautiful. Ehm then for some reason we go back to the supermarket, towards the bakery. Mom says: ""Oh come on come here, remember, you have to choose something to eat"". So I say: ""Ah well, excuse me, bye"" to this companion and I happily walk away. Uh I go back to this damn bakery and uhm I select: ""This piece of bread is fine here"" which is an elongated piece that is called something similar to ciabatta but it's not exactly that and looks more like a fried panzerotto. And once I said it: ""Ah, but that's just stuffed"", ""no listen, no. So uhm then I'll take this small bread"" and this small bread looked like fried popizze, they are de uhm fried pieces of pizza dough. They are rods, spheres. And so I take two of these because I couldn't figure out what the price was. I looked at them on display and it said ""Italian passport one euro and twenty, plus twenty cents explained"". Uh that is like folds removed and I didn't really understand, so I said: ""Oh well, those there and go"". Then mom and I left the supermarket, we took the car, which is a Nissan Micra, nice. Ehm mom drives, I sit in the passenger seat and we talk about it. So we're driving, it's all normal until, instead of normal roads, we become a single-lane, one-way street, with very high walls, like ten meters of brick that surround it closely. Not so narrow that you can't pass through it but it's low. And on top of these walls there is a woman who is watering the flowers with the hose and is very precise in watering the flowers that are on the other side of the wall ehm evidently she does not want to wet us. She is very nice and yet I signal her to splash us with water and then she does it. Ehm then this road here continues to get higher and higher with the walls, the lady is no longer seen, until mom and I arrive in front of a door. We get out of the car, we no longer have the car, the car is finished, nothing more. Ehm then it's me and mom uh the lady's pipe that goes down there but then comes back up to her, so it's there. In front of us there is a gallery like three meters high, normal, and as wide as these walls were and it is clearly damp ehm the walls are not brick but stone and my mom and I got out of the car, but only me enter because mom was gone, we just had to go home through this place. This place has several rusty doors erm weird, double leaf ehm and then we go inside, I have the phone in my hand. I go straight for a couple of steps, then turn left and once left there are three choices. One directed in front of me and two others on the left further, so I don't remember which one is usually chosen by mom and I. I try to go on one of these three, I can't, the door is closed. So I decide to call mom, I'm in a damp, dark tunnel and the phone doesn't pick up, so I decide to head back to the entrance and obviously it's barred by a rusty metal door. At that moment I feel very scared but in that moment I am no longer me. The child, the person who is there is a child and this child is halfway between the one with green hair Deku from My Hero Academia and a character from uhm Attack on Titan and is drawn with a style that is between the two, it is similar to the two. And then this child cries and you can hear the footsteps and the mother immediately comes to pick him up. They come out of this gallery and sit just outside, on the sidewalk. The scenery has changed, they are beautiful houses all white, all a bit old style and they are sitting there on the sidewalk. The mother is a woman, halfway between the mother of this Deku from My Hero Academia, so she has green hair too, but she also resembles a female character from Attack on Titan all time. And they're both drawn, they're both anime. Ehm then the mother begins to console the son who is scared ehm it seems that the dynamic has remained that the mother sent a message on the phone, on the chat where there was also a son, so the same thing that happened to me before. Ehm the son looks at his mother, with her eyes that are green stars, all intricate, drawn with white reflections everywhere, so just stars shining in these eyes and he says something like: ""Wow mom, you could surprise me on Zoom or a surprise on YouTube, but you can never surprise me in hell!"" and he dies. And so this son here died in his mother's arms and the mother is in shock. He is visibly shaking and at this point it becomes almost a freeze frame, in the sense that for a moment the animation stops and a guy comes out on the right side of what is now a screen because the animation has just stopped and with a stupid voice, he says like: ""But what is happening?!"" like Gabibbo and then the animation resumes and the mother,  always all drawn, it becomes gray in the face, loses color and you feel that he is about to let out an absurd scream."
DL086/DL086_night05.txt,"I was in an arcade and there is a chance to win really big puppets and they are so big that they are even out of the machine. Ehm then there is this beautiful puppet of Kurami, a Sanrio character and then I put in the effort, I put seven, eight euros in a machine and I manage to catch it like the second shot. I am very happy, I take the rest of the machine: it floods me with money, it gives me more money than I had put in it. And during all this the person who was at the counter of this arcade was very sour and complained about everything. ""Oh no the puppet can't stay there"", ""Oh no, you can't move as you want"", ""Eh but stop playing"". He didn't want me to take the puppet. So as soon as we won we went to put it in the car, my boyfriend and I put it in the trunk in the back, it barely fitted. Once back inside I started looking at the other cameras, however the ones where you fish things to win them and there were a lot of old technologies, that is, you could win an old camera, a flashlight, nothing nice."
DL086/DL086_night13.txt,I compared three hardcover books. I put all three of them next to each other and looked for differences in their cover.
DL086/DL086_night02.txt,"Something with demons and still something very cursed. At first I heard about this story as if I were a camera and the story happened to actors. Er, I used to go to a store. I was in a place that was not my home, I went to the beach. It was at my house. An introductory story of these two famous people, something on the wavelength of singers or a singer and an actor, in short, a girl and a boy who go on vacation in her remote house in the mountains, in the countryside. After some time that everything was normal, they begin to see strange things outside their window, like shadows that move and do not give them much weight but after that they also begin to see men and when they turn around for a moment, they blink, those men are no longer there. Erm they start to get more and more afraid, when at some point they also start to see men with large white crosses that seem to be places where someone has been buried. Um, this situation starts to get worse when the shadow men, they approach their windows uh and in short, something definitely happens with these men attacking both of them. Both actors, however, covered in blood outside the house, however, survived. Um, then I'm with my mom and I just went to a store, this store is a clothes store, a random fast fashion store, something like Pinky, something like Tally Weijl. Ehm I enter this store, I look around a bit, uhm especially mom moves away to one side, this store in line with other shops, but on one side and the other, so on the front and back uhm it has two entrances and both of these entrances have windows. Uhm mom goes somewhere else, I go to a corner to see some accessories. These accessories are hats, they are belts, then I move slightly and there are also dog harnesses and there are very small hats, really small that could really look good just over the head of a snake and they were just for that. There was a label with the word ""Hats"" uhm price eleven euros and I was shocked because it was much more than a hat for animals. Then I turn the label around and this was ""I specify small hat two euros and fifty instead of three euros and fifty"" and then I think: ""Ah ok, it's better"". Then I turn around, I entered the shop from the front and proceeded to the right instead my mother had gone to the left ehm so I turn from the right side to the window on the right and outside there is a lady talking very loudly on the phone and talking about how soon there will be a contest held by a local radio or something,  on the two people who look the most alike inside the shop. Um, then a crowd starts coming inside the store once they hear what this lady says. And I turn around, I look at her: ""Hi grandma!"", but in reality she is not my grandmother, she doesn't even look like him. She obviously doesn't hear me, she continues to walk but I still say this. Ehm then I start to turn around to see where my mother is, because we look alike anyway and she actually came out from the back, so she is looking at me from the window, from the left side. Ehm and then I signal her to come uh the shop is filling up with people. I'm with my friends and I explain everything I know about these things about demonic possession and unfortunately one of the friends found on the ground uh a little rectangular piece, a very small parallelepiped of what seems to be rose quartz but small, really, half the size of a grain of rice, it's early morning. Uh and this tiny pink piece means that men who see things out the window and then come to hurt you inside the house, are coming to that area too. So I start telling the story and I say that anyway all I know because I've seen it before is that this famous singer, like Spice Girls level, uh with this actor, they had gone on this vacation, in this country house but a death had happened among their friends, first there on a previous vacation or something and they had buried it,  He was dead. This was one of their friends, previously. And they had buried it, and all this had unleashed these demons, these shadows, these things. Ehm I'm talking about it with my friends. Then I'm on a scooter, I'm driving along the seafront. Ehm it's not a waterfront of any place I know it's a mix of a little bit of everything, but it's also a new thing that I've never seen. Erm, so I drive with the scooter, I park, there are many umbrellas and there is an umbrella where my parents have already arrived. So I, after driving a bit, catch up with them, I'm there uh after I say I'm going to take a bath. They warn me that it is dangerous and I make my way through the many umbrellas, there is sand, then it continues for a while with the water on top, but for a very short time, because immediately there are the rocks, really four steps. So I'm in the water, the water is pleasant. Erm, for some reason I don't feel happy at that moment and then I think I want to climb the rocks. But then I think, ""No, my parents know I'm not happy right now and if I get on the rocks they think maybe I want to dive and hurt."" So I approached the rocks, but in the end I didn't go anymore. So I proceed ehm looking towards the sea, towards my left ehm so I walk a little and at that moment eh, walking a little towards a part, after I have passed the rocks, the part before the sand rocks is normal, but the part after it is as if they were quicksand that the water gets deeper,  but both get their feet stuck in the sand. And then I accidentally put a foot there, I start to feel a little that I'm going down, that I'm drowning but fortunately I really only need two strokes and I'm back on the normal side. I get out of the water, I look around, I am indignant. How is this possible for the safety of all the people who are on the beach? Which are many, that is, as far as the eye can see, I see an umbrella attached next to the other for five, six rows, until I really can't see any more. The edges of the umbrellas really touch. Erm, so I'm outraged, I look left and right, I'm afraid for the other people there. There is an Indian family that is bathing eh then one of the children risks going that way, you can see that for a moment he has a problem and then I am scared. How is it possible that it is acceptable that there are quicksands? Ehm immediately the parents take it and nothing, it is resolved like that, but I stay there, standing like a fool, really angry. So I say, ""Ah patience, let's go get something."" I go back to the umbrella with my parents and we head towards uhm the establishments. In practice, the umbrellas are all attached to each other: six, seven rows on the beach. The establishment has an entrance that is wide all six rows and continues for a long time. So we go in there and head we want to get an ice cream, something like that, ehm walking there are various stands inside the establishment. The factory is made of this dark wood and is very large, it is six rows of umbrellas long, normal high and continues for a long time and one must, in short, it can go around various counters, various shops themselves inside this establishment. So, going towards the ice cream one I encounter one of the video games, and there are a lot of SD cards on the ground uh and some are video games for example, some are Pokémon, so they are on the ground. They don't belong to anyone, the people at the stand aren't looking at me, so I take them away, take them away and mom turns to me, looks at me, says: ""Well, do what you want"". Ehm I still look at those people who are at the stand, they didn't see me, so I take away a bigger card and a smaller card that were on the ground, just abandoned. Erm passed an alcohol counter, passed a few other counters. I'm inside my house, my parents are there. Ehm my parents are asking me to pack my bags anyway, because if this house were to become no longer a safe place we would have to go to another safe place. So I see in my clothes, there are gloves, there are a lot of things that are not clothes to take away, so, after what seemed like an eternity, I manage to put things in an envelope, in a suitcase. Uhm the main problem is the windows, because uhm they seem to be able to break the windows uhm well, once you get inside the house they hurt you. Ehm then I was in my room, I approach the kitchen again, there are my parents I tell him: ""Okay, I'm done with the suitcase"". I go back to my room and look towards the window. There's a guy with black hair there, I'm very scared. Until I recognize him, he's a friend of mine. So I say to him, ""Wretch, what are you doing there? You made me take a shot!"" and he said to me: ""Shall I let him in?"" or ""Will he come in alone?"", a bit scary. Ehm guy who teleported. And then he comes in and tells me: ""I needed a safe place to stay. I have no one, because...""... um, in short, something has happened to his parents. Uh then I let him in, I take him to the kitchen with my uhm and then we're there, we're all together, we're listening, we're sitting at the kitchen table, so we're four and we're listening to the noises uh you can hear the noises of the apartment above mine. Ehm it seems to be a rainy day ehm and the noises above are windows breaking. Killing noises and my neighbor screaming and that was it. And then for some reason these demons seem to be so powerful that they completely disappeared all the walls of our apartment above because the sign that they were coming for us was the fact that the whole wall starts to be soaked with water because it rains. The ceiling, all the walls as if they were plasterboard and the water begins to fall. So we look into each other's eyes, we all have our hands clasped in prayer and we know what is coming next. I was with friends and we all tried to pray anyway and it seemed to us that the better we prayed, the less the demons came to us. The place was quite dark, had few windows, but it still had it. Ehm we prayed and it was difficult, I tried to recite the Our Father and it didn't come to me at all. I would get the wrong words and then I thought it was my fault that the demons were coming."
DL086/DL086_night01.txt,Something about driving.
DL086/DL086_night15.txt,"There was some kind of festivity and I walked on the sidewalk very happy, that is, just hopping. Ehm and then I got in line to buy something at a stand like markets, street food. But then I changed my mind, I left."

DL050/DL050_night08.txt,"We were in a restaurant there was like, they fed chicken, meat, normal things. And we were talking about the fact that it wasn't normal for farmers to feed animals, I don't know, they would feed chicken to chickens, beef to steers and things like that and so we wanted to boycott the system that used animal cannibalism against animals. So we wanted to boycott chicken meats that had eaten chicken. But and so we were talking about this which is not right. We have to boycott and then we said to ourselves: ""but, see how you boycott? We just ate the oysters."" And we said in fact: ""eh and how do you do it? I mean, and what do you do, don't you eat oysters?"". As if to say, that is, impossible, right? And that is, having to give up oysters is too difficult, therefore, that is, if we cannot boycott oysters and then we do not boycott anything."
DL050/DL050_night07.txt,"There was Ibrahimovic, who was nervous on the pitch and I played with him. And so I knew he was nervous and nothing. And so I too felt a bit of nervousness, but he had to come home for dinner. And so it was me and [NAME1] on the balcony waiting for Ibrahimovic to come and so I was looking down from the balcony like that. Meanwhile there was [NAME2], who is one of my two cats, who comes, sniffs the plants, stands there with us on the balcony, like that. And it was a little too close to the railing. Suddenly, he leans too far from the railing and makes it as if he was falling. [NAME1] tries to catch it, takes it by the tail first and we pull it up. He then slides back and [NAME1] again takes him by his paw, only he can't hold him, he slips and he falls on a car down. I immediately run to go and get him. Except that [NAME1] seemed like you didn't care so much, laughed, said, ""no, nothing was done, it doesn't matter,"" like that. I was trying to get off to go and see what had happened, to go and help him. In the meantime the door didn't open, because then the door was locked, I manage to open, I get out, I run and there was him walking, and he pops up behind a car, he was walking all crooked, all in pain. But it was someone else, a cat different from him, a puppy. But I knew that he was the one who said to me: ""[NAME3], I'm dying, this time I got hurt"" and he had all his legs bent, shattered. I take him in my arms, I tell him: ""no, don't worry, you'll see now we can do it, it will be fine"", but I still assumed that I was telling him that you will see now it will be fine but I knew that most likely he would die later, he said: ""I can't do it"".
