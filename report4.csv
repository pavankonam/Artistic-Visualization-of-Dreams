case12_sub106.txt,"Karen: Yeah what was your dream? 
Subject: I dreamt I was in the lab here, and the outside world was like the conference room, and there were four people including me in the room, we were just sitting there talking, so I realized it was a dream because I had two other lucid dreams in this session that I woke up form, but I didn’t think they were lucid dreams but that’s complicated. Essentially, I realized I want in the lab, but it felt very real, and I wasn’t able to wake myself up from it, so I wasn’t sure if it was a dream or if it was reality. And i was able it signal fine in the dream, which I should have remembered that, and then trying to remember it I woke up. 
Karen: Cool, do you remember how you heard it in your dream? 
Subject: I heard the numbers
Karen: Cool, just like, from the sky or something? 
Subject: No it’s like from the surroundings. 
Karen: Nice, cool, it’s 10:05 what time do you want to get up? 
Subject: 10:30."

Subject: Let me remember. No I forgot it, I’m sorry. 
Karen: No that’s okay. Do you remember anything?
Subject: About the whole thing or about the last thing?
Karen: Um, the last thing. 
Subject: (No?)
Karen: Okay, cool. Were you having a dream, or are you not sure?
Subject: I was having a dream. 
Karen: Okay, cool, great. So that’s the end of your nap period, so we’re going to come wake you up, okay? 
Subject: Okay."
case20_sub111.txt,"Karen: Can you tell what was just going through your head?
Subject: I think there was a point where I was like kind of dreaming. I don’t really remember anything visually. I was singing a song, or like a song was going through my head, It was the Barber of seville. And at some point I woke up. 
Karen: Cool, and at any point during this did you know you were dreaming?
Subject: Yes. 
Karen: How did you know?
Subject: Um, I do remember hearing the noise. I realized something was going on, like where is my brain right now. 
Karen: Cool, and do you, how many beeps did you hear?
Subject: um, one, I think one. 
Karen: Cool, and did you hear any math problems?
Subject: Yes.
Karen: Do you remember what they were?
Subject: I remember 5 minus 2. I don’t remember the other one. I don’t remember the other one. I know there was another one. 
Karen: Cool, and did you give any eye signals?
Subject: yes. 
Karen: Do you remember what you gave?
Subject: I gave three for 5 minus 2. I think [indiscernible]
Karen: Cool, and so were you dreaming while you were doing these?
Subject: I don’t know, I might have been awake. I was definitely awake by the second time probably. 
Karen: So there’s still a bunch of time left in your nap so you can go back to sleep."
case25_sub117.txt,"Karen: Can you remember anything from you rnap?
Subject: Yeah. [long silence]
Karen: Can you tell me everything you remember?
Subject: I remember [indiscernible] uhh I remember I had [indiscernible] I had a song stuck in my head. 
Karen: Can you talk a bit louder? 
Subject: Yeah, do you want me to repeat that? 
Karen: Um yeah, 
Subject: Well um, (swimming?) [indiscernible] (song stuck in my head?) 
Karen: Cool, do you remember any of the sounds? 
Subject: Uh no
Karen: Cool, and do you remember doing any eye movements?
Subject: Yes
Karen: Can you tell me what you remember? 
Subject: Um, In the beginning I was like, I don’t know if it was training or not. I don’t know, It basically in the beginning I remember doing that. 
Karen: Cool, during the training or afterwards?
Subject: I think Afterwards.
Karen: And were you dreaming at that time? 
Subject: I wasn’t dreaming, but I think I really [indiscernible] I don’t like dreaming realistically, but then because we did that, I think that it affected my dream. 
Karen: You think what?
Subject: I think doing that affected my dream. 
Karen: How so? 
Subject: I usually don’t dream things that are realistic, but because I felt like I had to be aware of listening to the sounds, I was really conscious, and I think it affected my dream and made it more realistic. 
Karen: Okay, cool, Sweet, do you remember any other sounds or eye movements? 
Subject: No, 
Karen: Sweet so your nap period is over [cuts off abruptly]"
case32_sub122.txt,"Karen: 
Subject: Like almost a monitor or computer screen with text written on it. Once I saw that I was like, oh here we go. 
Karen: And were you lucid right at the beginning?
Subject: Pretty much as soon as that text showed up, I was like, alright, I can tell my mind is already wandering randomly, so I’ll let whatever comes next to come next.
Karen: And then what?
Subject: After the text, also I remember specifically while I was observing the text I could feel definitely different sensations in my body, as it was sending signals of like starting sleep, also when that text showed up I was pretty sure I tried to signal stage three or four. 
Karen: So... then what?
Subject: Um, well after that it was like random stuff that appeared afterwards. After that I fell completely asleep, and then it was about two scenarios completely. One on a sidewalk street corner, and the other one was just a normal sidewalk when I walked with a couple friends. 
Karen: And can you say again the sequence of events when you heard the cues and responded to them?
Subject: I remember specifically  the math problem, which I think was 5-3, was the one that showed up while I was walking down the sidewalk. I was just, I remember I was walking beside someone just normally, and observing, “Oh I know this person , we’re walking down a sidewalk, this is completely normal. I’m going to continue to act as if this is normal.” And then I think I tried to signal for one of the stages and then I heard the math problem, and then I tried to answer it. 
Karen: And do you remember how you heard the math problem in the dream?
Subject: Uh, I just heard, I don’t think it was ever presented in a different way in the dream. I don’t think the audio got incorporated in any way, in terms of like being a part of the dream, or coming from the dream, I understood that it came from a speaker. 
Karen: Do you feel like you heard it in your dream body or your waking body? 
Subject: I feel like I heard it in my waking body. It felt like I always had a good connection to my waking body the entire time while asleep, even though I could move in my lucid dream and walk around. 
Karen: Interesting, cool, and what was it like when you did the eye movements in your lucid dream? 
Subject: Uh, that was pretty normal it just felt like looking around. In that situation, ‘Cause I guess having a street corner and street was pretty convenient, because on one side there was a building and the other side there was a street so I just had to look from one to the other. 
Karen: Cool,
Subject: Yeah, I’m glad that worked out pretty well though, I’m curious to see the results."
case26_sub118.txt,"Karen: Can you tell em the last thing that was going through your head?
Subject: Uh, I’m trying to remember sorry. 
Karen: No worries. 
Subject: I do not remember, sorry. 
Karen: Okay no problem. Do you remember ayn other dreams from during your nap? 
Subject: Something about like, so back home like (walking the streets earlier?) 
Karen: Cool, do you remember anything else?

Karen: No worries that’s fine."
case10_sub106.txt,"Karen: Cool. Do you remember anything else?

case04_sub103.txt,"Karen: Hello?
Subject: Hi.
Karen: Can you tell me the last thing that was going through your head?

Karen: Cool. [long silence] Do you remember anything else?
Subject: [inaudible silence]
Karen: Can you say that one more time? 
Subject: [indiscernible] 
Karen: Can you talk a bit louder?
Subject: Yeah, yeah, sorry. I was [indiscernible] in a video game. There was a mine, where you had to, like, pickaxe your way through stone, and I was able to just hop over the stones, back behind them. I can’t… 
Karen: Cool, during this did you know that you were dreaming? 
Subject: Yes, because in the game you can’t just hop over the rocks.
Karen: So that let you know? 
Subject: Yeah. 
Karen: Sweet. Did you hear any of the cues?
Subject: I heard the most recent one. But I… yeah the most recent one. There’s a good chunk that I just don’t remember. I have no idea how long I’ve been asleep. [chuckles]
Karen: [chuckles] Um, cool. Did the cue appear in your dream when you heard it? 
Subject: Um, no. The sound… it probably was, but I was in the video game though, so it kinda sounds like the background theme. I think I was dreaming I was talking to my daughter, and that [indiscernible] green corduroy pants. And then when I heard the cue that’s when I like hopped into, started [indiscernible].  
Karen: Can you say that one more time? When you heard the cue what?
Subject: When I heard the cue I hopped into stardew valley just because I think the sounds took me into that world. 
Karen: Yeah
Subject: Yeah, but before that I was, it was weird. So I was talking to my daughter, but she’s two, so she doesn’t have an extensive vocabulary. She had a clipboard, she was like stage-managing. 
Karen: Do you remember anything else?
Subject: I remember things as I was falling asleep. Like, way before talking to my daughter in her green corduroy pants. It’s so… the top of a pomegranate. I don’t know why, but the color and imagery with the little green (spout?) of a pomegranate. And there’s this book she got for her birthday, that she keeps having us read again and again and again, like three times before she goes to bed, and it’s called they all saw a cat. And the cat walked through the world with her whiskers, ears, and paws. And it’s like all these different, and the child sees the cat, and she’s have me turn the page [indiscernible] different. [indiscernible] And there’s one page where a mouse sees the cat, and it’s the weirdest page in the whole book because it’s just black and red with claws and eyes. It’s pretty scary for a kid’s book. At the end, there’s a page where it’s like, “Yes they all saw a cat.” And it’s the cat sitting together with all these different, like sets of people, like these different perspectives of a cat. So it’s got this really big cheshire grin when the child sees the cat. But then a bat sees a cat, so it’s like [indiscernible]. You know how echolocation, so the cat is just like, it’s basically just like a star. And a worm sees a cat, and it’s all about vibrations. So it’s this weird cat together with all of these textures and colors. 
Karen: So that’s what you saw as you were falling asleep?
Subject: Yeah.
Karen: Cool. And did you hear any of the math problems? 
Subject: No. [laughter]
Karen: [laughter] And did you do any eye signals? 
Subject: I feel like I tried to. I remember, like, finger tapping instead of, I don’t know, not my finger, no, I need to do my eyes. And then I fell back asleep. 
Karen: And when was that?
Subject: Awhile ago, I don’t know. 
Karen: Okay, cool. Do you remember if it was from the beginning part or the dream you had later?
Subject: I think it was more towards the beginning. 
Karen: Okay, cool. One last question. Can you estimate how long the dream was, that you were having before you woke up? 
Subject: Like a reality estimate, or how I felt that I was dreaming? 
Karen: Both, one in like minutes and seconds estimate, and one in the number of dream states. 
Subject: I don’t know, it was probably two minutes max in reality, and… it was probably a lot shorter than that. For me it felt more like a half hour maybe 20 minutes. 
Karen: Cool, and just to clarify, you heard one cue right? 
Subject: Yes. 
Karen: Sweet. Do you remember anything else that you want to say? 
Subject: A feeling, umm… maybe I was just paying too much attention to the cat as I was sleeping. I would feel like little, you know, probably just imagining, like trying to get my hair out of the way, like tiny little pinpricks. And like weird I don’t know, like suddenly I would get little (barbing?) and I would feel my eyes roll, like, over to the spot where I was like, woah, where, I don’t know, where I could just feel my heart was…[laughter] in space.
Karen: Cool. Alright cool, well your nap period is over, so we’re going to come and unhook you, okay? 
Subject: alright."
case29_sub121.txt,"Prompt: Describe everything you can remember from your dreams and/or other experiences during sleep, including any details you can remember such as the sequence of events, your thoughts, sensations, and/or feelings.
i remember each time i heard a sound cue or heard a math problem (heard the sound cue more than saw that light cue) my dream would take complete pause. like no one would be moving and my dream wouldnt start replaying until i finished my task. the dream that i can most vividly remember is where i was sitting in one of my old classrooms in high school and i was sitting through class and my old math teacher was teaching on the blackboard and he kept writing down the same one equation over and over again really largely on the blackboard. i cant remember the equation but it was a jumble of numbers. i remember thinking that i understood what he was writing even though for me in reality it wouldnt make sense
Prompt:Were you at any point lucid, aware that you were dreaming while still asleep?
Yes
Prompt: If so, describe when and how you realized you were dreaming.
it was after one of the cues where my dream took a pause and after my task where my dream started playing again but i realized i was dreaming
Prompt: Did you notice any cues, the flashing lights or the beeping sounds, while you were dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, describe how they appeared in your dream. 
it would be only the sound cues or math problems and it would be like i heard something in a far distance. so the first word would be soft and muggy but then my dream would pause and it got clearer. and when i had to draw out the number in my dream for the math problem my vision was black and then the number would be traced on top of the black background and then my dream would start again
Prompt: Did you do any eye movements while you were dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, how many times and what was it like? Were they in response to cues? 
i think around 4 times in response to the light cues / math problems i did left and right eye movements. in response to just the light cues though without the number tracing, my vision didnt go black but my dream still took a pause.
Prompt: Did you hear any of the words while you were asleep and/or dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, describe how they appeared in your dream. 
i dont remember the exact equations, i think i answered around 2 and i remember one vividly because the first number was fuzzy and i only heard minus 3 so i was thinking really hard what the first number could have been and if i got the answer right or wrong
they appeared as a distant voice like as if someone said something in the back of the classroom and i happened to eavesdrop of something. it was difficult hearing the first portion because that was my initial exposure but then when it go to the last number of the math problem i could hear it clearly. it took me a while to adjust my hearing
Prompt: Is there anything else you remember thinking, feeling, or experiencing during the nap? 
my dream was as if i was watching from the outside in and not me actually in my physical body so everytime i heard a sound cue it was only me who turned my head or reacted in response to a cue and no one else noticed it. 
Prompt: If you haven't already mentioned it, describe how you woke up, and how you felt after waking up. If you haven't already mentioned it, describe how you woke up, and how you felt after waking up. 
i woke up after hearing my name through the speaker and remember my last thought before waking up was figuring out my last math equation and what the first number was before the minus 3 part because i wanted to get the answer right. when i woke up i felt kind of groggy i dont know why but that was just how i felt"
case30_sub121.txt,"Prompt: Describe everything you can remember from your dreams and/or other experiences during sleep, including any details you can remember such as the sequence of events, your thoughts, sensations, and/or feelings.
I went to sleep right after we did the practice cues. It wasn't much but i was in my kitchen back at home cooking with my mom for some kind of large gathering. we were cooking traditional korean foods and even went outside to our garden to pick out the homegrown vegetables that we have. it all seemed very fast though, time just went by pretty fast as in like transitions during scenes just occurred right away
Prompt:Were you at any point lucid, aware that you were dreaming while still asleep?
No
Prompt: If so, describe when and how you realized you were dreaming.
Prompt: Did you notice any cues, the flashing lights or the beeping sounds, while you were dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, describe how they appeared in your dream. 
i heard the noise cue in my dream as if there was a speaker in the kitchen and was like a part of my dream
Prompt: Did you do any eye movements while you were dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, how many times and what was it like? Were they in response to cues? 
just once before i was woken  up. my dream took a  pause and i was back into reality knowing that i was a part of this study but could also see the setting of my dream very faintly kind of like in the back of my mind
Prompt: Did you hear any of the words while you were asleep and/or dreaming? 
No
Prompt: If so, describe how they appeared in your dream. 
Prompt: Is there anything else you remember thinking, feeling, or experiencing during the nap? 
i definitely didnt completely wake up when i heard the noise cue because i was woken up by karens voice over the speaker which brought me completely to reality. i felt like i was half dreaming half knowing that i was sleeping for the study
Prompt: If you haven't already mentioned it, describe how you woke up, and how you felt after waking up. If you haven't already mentioned it, describe how you woke up, and how you felt after waking up. 
felt a little groggy like i wanted to go back to sleep and keep dreaming"

Subject: I think I might have knocked the speaker down. 
Karen: Oh that’s totally fine, it’s super hard to hear. Can you tell me what you were dreaming about? 
Subject: I think I was having lunch, like I was gonna get lunch for class. I think I might have, there were periods of time where I woke up and then I like drifted again, yeah, so it wasn’t very consistent, but that was the last thing. 
Karen: Do you remember anything before that?
Subject: No. 
Karen: Cool, and at any point during that time did you know that you were dreaming?
Subject: Yes, but like it wasnt, I can’t tell if I knew that I was dreaming in the dream or outside of the dream. Like, I can’t tell…. There were certain times when I would hear the math, and then do it, and then wake up. 
Karen: Yeha, so do you think that you did it while you were dreaming or afterwards?
Subject: Like in the middle
Karen: yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally normal
Subject: Like, I would do it, like I would wake up as I did it. 
Karen: and do you remember what the math problems were?
Subject: There was one, which was 9 minus 8, which I think I answered two. 
Karen: Do you remember how many there were?
Subject: No, maybe four? 
Karen: Do you remember any of the beeping noises?
Subject: Only like twice? 
Karen: and do you remember doing any signals?
Subject: Yes, yes so the beeping noises, I felt like…., I think like the first couple times, or like the two times I can remember doing it. There was one I was like awake for, and then there was one where I did it, and then I woke up. 
Karen: Okay, did it come into your dream?
Subject: It was like an alarm clock. So I think, I was like dreaming, then I heard it, and the dream stopped. 
Karen: and did you hear any of the math problems in you dream?
Subject: They weren’t part of the dream. They were also like alarm clocks. 
Karen: Got it cool, do you remember anything else? 
Subject: No."

Subject: I can
Karen: What do you remember?

So I was talking to a friend in my apartment, and like, just like something was different. Where like someone new came into my apartment, who never did before. But, I didn’t realize it. I questioned it then the dream changed, into like another scene. 
Karen: Ah, cool, do you remember anything else?
Subject: I had another one, but I don’t remember that one. 
Karen: Cool, and did you hear any of the noises while you were asleep?

case09_sub106.txt,"Karen: Can you tell me the last thing that was going through your head?
Subject: I was dreaming about having a conversation about my favorite video game with someone I didn’t know. And then, like, it’s complicated. I was in a parking lot at night walking back from target on Sheridan. Then suddenly it was daytime and I was in the video game that I was talking about. Then I thought, okay this is probably a dream. And then something weird happened my entire body, like, in real life collapsed. It felt like it collapsed like I lost control of all my muscles. There was a roaring of blood rushing to my ears kind of sound. I think it might have been sleep paralysis or something like that. But then I don’t know how I got out of it. 
Karen: Interesting. 
Subject: Yeah. 
Karen: So do you remember hearing the cues?
Subject: Uh, no. I remember hearing one cue but I was awake. 
Karen: But you were awake?
Subject: But I was awake so I didn’t give a sign. 
Karen: Okay, do you remember hearing any math problems?
Subject: Yeah, well not during the (normal sleep?) but like 8 – 6.
Karen: Okay, And, were you asleep when I played them?
Subject: i think I was. 
Karen: Were you in the dream?
Subject: I honestly have no idea if I was in the dream or in the state where I couldn’t, like, move. I think as soon as I entered the state, I was still in the dream. Then I signalled I was lucid, but I don’t know if I woke up in the middle of that, but I still signalled because I didn’t know, which was weird. I know this is a grey area. But I didn’t know if I was awake or not. 
Karen: Okay, cool. So you got your sleep paralysis type thing, and you signalled, and then you heard the math problem. 
Subject: Mhm. 
Karen: Do you remember how many math problems you heard?
Subject: I think I heard 3. 
Karen: Cool. And do you remember how many you answered and what you answered? 
Subject: I answered 2 for all of them, but I don’t remember what the first one was. I just remember the last one was 8 – 6. 
Karen: Cool. And so, just one more question. When you entered, when your body collapsed, and you were in whatever you were in, Was the dream still going on? 
Subject: I think the shock value was enough that it stopped. I was just confused, and I thought in the moment that I was, like, in a dream because it felt like my body had gone to sleep. Then I thought I was in a dream, like, in the lab, which would’ve made sense. But the image of the dream of the video game stopped when my body went into that sleep paralysis type thing. 
Karen: Okay sweet, very interesting. You still have about 45 minutes, and those are all my questions so … [abruptly cuts off]."

Karen: Cool, do you remember what they were?
Subject: No.
Karen: Cool, and did you try to do any eye movements?
Subject: I think I did when I first started, like, (first softly?). I think that’s it.
Karen: Cool, but none just now?

Karen: Okay, cool. And do you remember what it was?

Karen: Do you remember anything else?
Subject: Occasionally I could feel my body slowly drifting, like the sensations were drifting away, and I could feel myself coming closer to falling asleep, but I could then also feel my heart rate suddenly go up as I recognized that and I think that prevented me from falling deeper into sleep. 
Karen: Cool, and did you see or hear any cues or do any eye movements?
Subject: A few cues, I didn’t hear any math problems this time though, 
Karen: Cool, and how many did you respond to?

Subject: Nope. 
Karen: do you remember anything else from the nap?
Subject: Well it was interesting because during my nap I twas in a psych study. So now that I think about it, I was hearing math questions. But I didn’t think of them. In my dream I was in a psych study so I didn’t say the answer, because I thought that I was still awake. 
Karen: Cool, do you remember how many you heard?
Subject: I want to say I heard , I couldn’t tell you the number but for some reason I remember a 7 minu 4 one. 
Karen: Awesome, do you have like a ballpark?

Karen: yeah.

Subject: Yeah
Karen: Can you tell me what you remember? 
Subject: Um, I remember like responding to the chime, and… but I heard a math problem first. That’s when I realized I was dreaming. Um, and I think I heard two math questions. The math questions then the chime then another math question. 
Karen: Cool. And can you tell me about the eye signals you did? 
Subject: Just the left right left for the number that corresponded to whatever the answer to the problem was. And just ht left right left twice for the chime.

Karen: Do you remember what it was?

Karen: Cool, what were you dreaming? 
Subject: I was dreaming I was in a cafe that was on the top floor of Swift. Um, and I was trying to make oatmeal for myself and I got distracted, and I was on this like open computer that they had in the lab, and I was just trying to like write some code on the computer. Then I got a message from the computer. Did you play any other sounds during the dream, that was like a high pitch beep. Like a notification sound? 
Karen: Um, no. 
Subject: Cool, I heard a high pitch notification sounds, and I got a notification on the computer in green, that said I was gonna participate in something called the BlueEp lab. And then right about then I got the signal, and I signalled in the dream that I was lucid. Then I looked around. I tried to make some guy’s head explode, because you know, you can control the dreams, but it didn’t work. And then you gave me the cue. And I looked left in the dream, but as I looked right in the dream to answer I woke up. 
Karen: And how did you know that you were lucid? 
Subject: Wel, I’m not sure, but you gave me the cue so I assumed I was. 
Karen: Yeah, like did you know before the cue.

case31_sub121.txt,"i remember for the majority of being asleep i was at my old house that i was in as a child and i was just standing across the street from it looking at it in the rain and then all of a sudden old memories from different parts of the house started playing where they would just flash in my dreams. but i cant remember  specifically about what each flashback was or even if they happened for real when i was a kid
Prompt:Were you at any point lucid, aware that you were dreaming while still asleep?
Yes
Prompt: If so, describe when and how you realized you were dreaming.
when the light cue came on. i think that got incorporated into my dream and that flash started the flashbacks that started in my dreams. the flashbacks were like a montage you see in a movie and each scene/ memory was initiated by that light flash that was given by the cue.
Prompt: Did you notice any cues, the flashing lights or the beeping sounds, while you were dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, describe how they appeared in your dream. 
like before the light cue just flashed a new scene in my dream and the sound cue was just something i heard faintly in the distance
Prompt: Did you do any eye movements while you were dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, how many times and what was it like? Were they in response to cues? 
i think i cued around 4 times if i remember correctly. in response to the cues, it kind of brought me back to reality (knowing that i was doing this study) but part of me was still sleeping/ dreaming and the two settings mixed up a little. for example, the light cue was incorporated in my dream state with the ""flash backs"" that i had
Prompt: Did you hear any of the words while you were asleep and/or dreaming? 
Yes
Prompt: If so, describe how they appeared in your dream. 
i heard three. the first one i answered the second one i couldnt understand fully and the third one i answered. i answered by doing the eye movements and then pictured the math problem on the house number plate thing on the outside of my old house
after the math problem and answering and picturing it on the house number plate, i went back to just looking at my old house from the outside from a perspective across the street. i didn't have difficulty completing them because at that point there wasnt alot of things going on in my dream so it was easy to distinguish my dream state and my awake state
Prompt: Is there anything else you remember thinking, feeling, or experiencing during the nap? 
i felt like i was 60 percent awake and aware i was waiting on some sort of cue and 40 percent still in my dream waiting for something to happen in my dream
Prompt: If you haven't already mentioned it, describe how you woke up, and how you felt after waking up. If you haven't already mentioned it, describe how you woke up, and how you felt after waking up. 
i woke up after my third math problem after picturing on my house number plate. at that time i think i was more towards 80 percent awake because i was becoming more aware of listening for the cues but i noticed that when karen woke me up completely through the speaker it took me a couple seconds to come to fully come back to an awake state which meant to me that i was still in a light dreaming state towards the end of my dream"

Karen: Awesome do you remember anything else?
Subject: Before that? No I was shifting. I would like doze off and lay back. I thought I heard you in the distance, but I couldn’t hear them loud enough for the math questions. But I couldn’t hear, I thought I said 1, but like I said, like actually said it. 
Karen: Cool, so did you hear any of the math problems?
Subject: No, I don’t think… I mean I didn’t.

Subject: Okay, yeah. 
Karen: No, I’m just clarifying. I’m asking you what you thought.
